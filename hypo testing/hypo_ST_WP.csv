Asked yesterday if the party would follow the PAP in announcing its line-up before Nomination Day on Tuesday, Mr Singh said the WP would be sticking to the strategy it used in recent elections.

""Everybody has their own strategy that they bring to the table... Traditionally, the Workers' Party has always kept its cards close to its chest until Nomination Day,"" he said. ""And I think this is understandable. As a small player in the political scene, I think there are not many elements that we have in our favour, but one of them is actually surprise.""

He added: ""So, I would think that there will be no change to the plan to announce the candidates via the Nomination Day process. I think that will be the case unless something comes up before then.""

The WP has in the past sprung some last-minute surprises.

In 2011, it was not until the morning of Nomination Day, when then party chief Low Thia Khiang boarded the bus for the Aljunied GRC nomination centre, that it was confirmed he would leave his stronghold of Hougang to contest a group constituency.

WP is contesting 21 seats this year, and has revealed the identities of candidates in only Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC.

During a press conference where the party introduced new candidates, Mr Singh also spoke about how the party picks its candidates.

He was responding to a question about how the WP would react if their candidates found themselves in the same circumstances as PAP candidate Ivan Lim. Mr Lim had been criticised online by people who said they have had bad experiences with him in the past.

Mr Singh said all candidates fielded by his party are observed for a period as volunteers, and then as party members, before they are considered for elections. But he said there was no way to ensure they would not have skeletons in their closet.

""What we have to do in the circumstances is to make some decisions based on all the information that we have in our hands,"" he said. ""At times, we've also had to speak to the bosses of some of our candidates or their friends to have a better feel of a person, but, generally, I don't believe there's a fail-safe mechanism out there.""

A PROMISE This is my promise if elected: I will serve my constituents and the people of Singapore by speaking up for the powerless and speaking truth to power, and I will do this to the best of my abilities. NEW CANDIDATE MUHAMMAD FADLI MOHAMMED FAWZI, on having a soft spot for the underdog, and his concern for the powerless and marginalised in Singapore.

The WP introduced five candidates yesterday, three of whom are contesting their first election.

Mr Nathaniel Koh, 36, was a former member of the WP's youth wing and served as an election agent for the party in 2015 in the now-defunct Sengkang West SMC.

The IT professional, who works at security systems supplier Dormakaba Singapore, has been married for six years, and he and his wife are expecting their first child in September.

Mr Koh said he joined WP in 2009, when he was still a student at the Singapore Management University, as he believes that having diversity in Parliament is crucial to the long-term success of Singapore.

Asked what issues he would like to raise in Parliament, he said more needs to be done to encourage families to have children.

""It's not necessarily about monetary incentives like the baby bonus. We have to look at social incentives as well,"" he said, adding that policies must encourage both parents to care for their newborns and give them more time for childcare.

Ms Tan Chen Chen, 38, a contracts administrator and trained quantity surveyor, said she had volunteered with the party in the Bedok area after the previous election in 2015.

Speaking in Mandarin at the press conference, the mother of a three-month-old said property prices are an important issue today, especially to young Singaporeans.

Ms Tan added that the high prices may make it more difficult for today's young people to have enough for retirement later on as they may have to dip into their Central Provident Fund savings to pay for the flat. She said this is an issue she would like to raise in Parliament.

Lawyer Muhammad Fadli Mohammed Fawzi, 40, said he was concerned about the ""powerless and marginalised"" in Singapore, which he described as a country where power is concentrated in the hands of one party.

He said he ""always had a soft spot for the underdog"" and had attended opposition rallies since his youth.

He added: ""This is my promise if elected: I will serve my constituents and the people of Singapore by speaking up for the powerless and speaking truth to power, and I will do this to the best of my abilities.""

The other two candidates introduced yesterday had contested in the 2015 General Election.

Mr Kenneth Foo Seck Guan, 43, ran in Nee Soon GRC, and his team lost to the incumbent PAP, with 33.2 per cent of the vote.

The deputy director in a charity organisation has been a legislative assistant to party chair Sylvia Lim since the start of last year.

Mr Terence Tan, a lawyer and director at the firm Robertson Chambers, will turn 49 on Nomination Day. He contested Marine Parade GRC in 2015 and his team garnered 35.9 per cent of the vote.

He is the deputy organising secretary in the WP's central executive committee.

At the session, Mr Singh also said that the WP's manifesto will be released today, together with its final batch of candidates.

Mr Tan is a litigation lawyer who has been volunteering with the WP since 2011. He is married and has two sons.

In his electoral debut in 2015, the WP team in Marine Parade GRC garnered 35.9 per cent of the votes against the incumbent PAP team led by former prime minister Goh Chok Tong.

Mr Tan said yesterday that what he hopes to achieve in politics has not changed. ""I hope to ensure that the interests of Singaporeans are always placed at the very forefront of the Government's policies.

""Covid-19 has stress-tested the resilience of our economy and our savings. Singaporeans are understandably anxious for their families.""

Singapore faces ""many perils ahead"" and it needs a more diverse and inclusive Parliament with constructive and robust debates, he added.

""I appeal to Singaporeans to consider whether we should continue down the same path without at least appointing a few people to call out instances where the emperor may not wear clothes.""

In 2015, Mr Foo ran on the Workers' Party ticket in Nee Soon GRC. With 33.2 per cent of the vote, his team lost.

He became the party's deputy organising secretary in 2016, and served in that role until 2018.

Last year, he became a legislative assistant to Aljunied GRC MP and WP chairman Sylvia Lim.

In this capacity, he has been very busy over the past few weeks, as residents have been asking for help to apply for various grants and schemes to tide them over the Covid-19 period, he said yesterday.

He said: ""In the midst of Covid-19, we're calling an election. A lot of things must be going through the residents' minds: Why am I having an election at this time? But I'm not there to help them answer that.

""In fact, I'll put that question back to them to say it is a good question that you might need us to go into Parliament to help to ask.""

On the topic of transparency, he said that WP MPs have filed many parliamentary questions about key statistics that affect Singaporeans' lives.

""Some got answered. Some were half-answered. Some got no answer at all,"" said Mr Foo.

""I find this situation totally unacceptable, and we need to have a strong opposition presence in Parliament to hold the Government accountable for its actions.""

For the past five years, Mr Nathaniel Koh was the friendly face greeting those who turned up at the Meet-the-People sessions of Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh.

Yesterday, he was unveiled as one of the new faces the party will field this election.

Mr Koh, who was described as a ""GE veteran"" by WP party chairman Sylvia Lim yesterday, was an election agent and volunteer for the campaign of WP Sengkang West candidate Koh Choon Yong in 2011 and 2015.

Explaining why he decided to take the plunge as a candidate only now, after having been in the party since 2009, he said: ""I am standing in this election as a continuation of my journey to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, to help put Singapore on the clearer path to navigate the challenges ahead, and to make Singapore better than it is today.""

If elected, he said he hopes to champion the cause of young families.

Mr Koh, whose wife is expecting their first child, said he wanted to reduce the obstacles that young parents face in caring for their children by looking at social and not just financial incentives.

It was a soft spot for the underdog that got Mr Muhammad Fadli interested in opposition politics.

""We would always fight hard but always lose. But when we won, such as in Aljunied in 2011, it was something special. I guess I saw part of myself in that struggle - always having to fight harder and facing more difficulties to earn your place in the world,"" he said yesterday.

""But, to be honest, I would have it no other way.""

Having graduated from the National University of Singapore with a master's degree in sociology, Mr Muhammad Fadli worked for five years at the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. He went on to earn a Juris Doctor from the Singapore Management University.

Yesterday, he said: ""Many voters are sometimes afraid to vote for us, thinking that having more opposition will weaken the country. But this is exactly the opposite. When the Workers' Party speaks out, we are speaking out on behalf of Singaporeans who, for one reason or the other, feel that they are being left behind as the country moves forward.""

He added that with the WP in Parliament, the Government would be more responsive, and ""when we speak truth to power, we do so constructively because we believe that only by doing so can we make Singapore the inclusive and resilient country that each and every Singapore citizen deserves"".

Ms Tan Chen Chen may not have been a top student when she was in school, but she hopes that voters will give her a chance as she is ""willing to work hard and against the odds for what she wants"".

Since 2015, she has been volunteering at the Bedok Reservoir-Punggol ward of Aljunied GRC, helping out at the Meet-the-People sessions of former Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang.

Yesterday, as she was introduced as the WP's new face, she said in Mandarin: ""I hope there can be more (opposition MPs) in Parliament who will speak up on behalf of the people and help improve their lives, and not just oppose for the sake of opposing.""

She urged young Singaporeans to take an interest in politics, as it is necessary for them to chart their future.

The mother of a three-month-old child said the affordability of housing for young people is an issue close to her heart. She estimated that after buying a flat in a non-mature estate, a young couple will have to spend the next 30 years or so paying off the mortgage. ""By the time they reach 55, there will not be much left in their Central Provident Fund. How will we enjoy life? So housing prices will be my focus,"" she said.",0.42531691372600455,0.07356746578337486,Positive

Speaking at the party's candidate introduction press conference, Mr Singh noted that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) will have a strong mandate even if the WP wins all the 21 seats it is contesting.

""The PAP are going to contest in 93 seats, the Workers Party is contesting in 21 seats, and that leaves us potentially 72 seats in PAP's hands. I'm not sure whether that equates to a weak mandate. I think that's still a strong mandate for the PAP,"" he said.

""So what I believe Singaporeans should also consider is, as all of us collectively fight Covid-19, what about the balance in Parliament?""

Mr Singh also responded to a question about how the WP would react if their candidates find themselves in the same circumstances as PAP candidate Ivan Lim, who has been criticised online by some who say they have had bad experiences with him in the past.

He said all candidates fielded by his party are observed for a period as volunteers and then as party members before they are considered for elections, but even then, there is no guarantee that they will not have skeletons in their closet.

Most WP members start out as volunteers before they become full members and this process allows the party leaders and senior party members to observe and make judgment calls about a person, before they decide if he or she is ""able to serve the public wholeheartedly"", Mr Singh added.

He said the party has on occasion also spoken to the employers and friends of potential candidates.

But he added that there is ""no fail-safe mechanism out there"" and what the party can do is to make decisions based on all the information it has.

The WP introduced five candidates on Saturday, three of whom are contesting in their first election.

""It's not necessarily about monetary incentives, like the baby bonus. We have to look at social incentives as well,"" he said, adding that policies must encourage both parents to care for their newborn babies and give them more time for childcare.

Mothers who want to re-enter the workforce after childbirth should also be encouraged and enabled to do so.

Ms Tan Chen Chen, 38, a contracts administrator and trained quantity surveyor, said she had been volunteering with the party in the Bedok area after the previous election in 2015.

Speaking in Mandarin throughout the press conference, the mother of a three-month-old said property prices are an important issue today, especially to young Singaporeans.

She said the prices of Housing Board flats have risen to the point that young people starting out with salaries of between $2,000 and $3,000 will find it difficult to afford a home.

Ms Tan added that the high prices may make it more difficult for today's young people to have enough to retire later on as they may have to dip into their CPF savings to pay for the flat, and that this is an issue she would like to raise in Parliament.

2,31,WP,https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/time-will-tell-what-low-thia-khiangs-legacy-in-politics-is,2020-06-27 05:00:00+08:00,Singapore GE2020: Time will tell what Low Thia Khiang's legacy in politics is,"When news broke on Thursday of opposition stalwart Low Thia Khiang's retirement from electoral politics, a big question on the minds of many political pundits was how this would affect the chances of the Workers' Party (WP).

For years, Mr Low, 63, has been the face of the party.

Even now, nine years after he left Hougang SMC to lead a team at Aljunied GRC in 2011, some Hougang residents declare that they will vote for any WP candidate there, just because they trust the man they affectionately refer to as ""Ah Low"".

But is it merely a cult of personality that draws voters to the party?

Asked on Thursday how his decision to step down would affect the WP at the polls, Mr Low said with a laugh: ""I do not know how many voters vote solely because of me.""

He added: ""I have always maintained that a party cannot depend on just an individual or a few individuals.""

It is a position he has hewed closely to.

As a member of the party since 1982, he had witnessed first-hand how disruptive it could be if a party's fate was tied too closely to a personality.

When he took over as party chief in 2001, the WP was in disarray.

Its erstwhile secretary-general J.B. Jeyaretnam had been bankrupted by lawsuits and could not contest elections.

The resulting internal strife, with Mr Low blamed for not doing enough to help Mr Jeyaretnam, almost caused the opposition to become ""extinct"", Mr Low had said.

Knowing full well how dangerous it could be to turn politics into a game of personality, he set out very early to renew the party's ranks.

In 2001, he, at age 45, was among the youngest in the party's top decision-making body.

The party's current central executive committee has five members in their 40s.

Although many deemed he had a few good years left, Mr Low stepped down as party chief in 2018, making way for current secretary-general Pritam Singh.

Since then, he has kept a low profile in Parliament, perhaps to ensure his successor is not eclipsed by him.

On Thursday, Mr Low said he was once asked by a reporter what the WP could do for voters with just one person in Parliament.

""My answer was, the reality is that what a party can do depends on how the people sustain it. Of course, as one person, there are limitations to what I can do.

""With more people... the People's Action Party (PAP) will see that voters have more support for the opposition... and they will rethink their policies.""

To attract enough of the middle ground to sustain the WP, he had also set out to transform the WP into what he has described as a ""responsible opposition party"" that people would respect.

The first change along this direction was a seemingly insignificant one - changing the sartorial style of WP members.

In a 2011 interview with The Straits Times, Mr Low said one of his earliest tasks as party chief was to nag WP members to dress more neatly for walkabouts instead of doing it in their preferred attire of T-shirts and slippers.

""I think if we want to move together as a party and you want people to look at you, to respect you, you have to respect yourself with more discipline,"" he added.

When he joined the WP, the party under Mr Jeyaretnam took a more adversarial approach.

But Mr Low never believed in opposing for the sake of doing so, and transformed the party in his mould.

Under his leadership, the WP has taken a more moderate line and in the process created a brand of opposition politics based on constructive criticism.

Even the PAP has described him as a ""constructive opposition politician"".

Describing how the party has evolved on Thursday, Mr Low acknowledged that less combative, aggressive politics is what the new generation of Singaporeans want.

""I would think that I am more aggressive, but the younger generation like Pritam and Leon, maybe they want a different approach, which I think is not a bad thing,"" he said, referring to Mr Singh and Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera.

""They respond appropriately and they make a point, although they don't go for some attack here and there like me. But never mind, lah.""

After taking over, Mr Singh has often reiterated that he would continue on the path Mr Low has set to make the WP ""a loyal opposition which is interested in Singapore and Singaporeans"".

It has been nine years since Mr Low left Hougang to lead the WP's charge in neighbouring Aljunied GRC, and since then, Hougang has gone through two other WP MPs and will see a third WP candidate this coming election.

Yet, there continues to be die-hard supporters in Hougang who have kept their allegiance to Mr Low, even after his departure from the single-seat constituency.

While he still remains a WP member, his stepping down from electoral politics may not have much effect on their vote.

But in Aljunied GRC, where he has not gained the same traction, there is a chance that some voters, who have voted for the WP to keep Mr Low in Parliament, may no longer feel the need to do so.

Just how this ""Low Thia Khiang effect"" will affect the WP's chances at the ballot box is anyone's guess.

For many, his biggest achievement as a politician is in leading an opposition party to victory in Aljunied GRC in 2011.

But it remains to be seen if his biggest contribution to Singapore's political development will be in building up an opposition party larger than himself, and creating a brand of constructive politics that will survive the test of time.

It is undeniable that the WP of today has the imprint of Mr Low all over it.

As his influence slowly fades, it is up to the WP's current leaders to show they will remain steadfast to these values so that voters will know that even without Mr Low, they will get in the WP an opposition that wants to serve as a check on the Government, and not replace it.",0.34826515151515164,0.08801704545454545,Positive

WP chief Pritam Singh yesterday confirmed the line-up of candidates to defend the lone group representation constituency held by an opposition party.

Mr Singh, party chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap will be joined by former Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) Gerald Giam and Leon Perera, who will replace former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwart Chen Show Mao, the party said yesterday, amid speculation there might be further changes to the team.

WP had on Thursday announced that Mr Low, the longest-serving opposition MP in Parliament, Mr Chen and incumbent Hougang SMC MP Png Eng Huat will not stand for election this time, in line with its leadership renewal plans.

Party organising secretary Dennis Tan, who became an NCMP after the 2015 election, will stand in Hougang SMC.

Asked if the decision by the party stalwarts not to contest might place the WP on the defensive, Mr Singh replied: ""The Workers' Party is an opposition party. We have been in opposition for many decades now. And when we fight, we fight to win.

""And we do our best to persuade Singaporeans, the residents in Hougang and Aljunied, to cast their vote for us. Now over the last five years, the residents in Hougang and Aljunied can see for themselves what we have achieved in the town, and we leave this decision on who they want to vote for in their good hands.""

Political observer Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said the WP was playing to its strengths.

""From the crop of candidates recently unveiled, Gerald, Leon and Dennis are all former NCMPs who have parliamentary experience,"" he said. These are important traits that strengthen the WP's Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC candidates, he added.

He said the WP's strategy of keeping the other three members of the Aljunied GRC team within the constituency could be to its advantage, as it allows for more continuity for voters.

Dr Mustafa said: ""The WP, as the incumbent, has an advantage. As elected representative of the people in Aljunied and Hougang, voters would be likely to give them the opportunity to re-affirm what they have done to win the votes.""

At yesterday's press conference, WP also introduced five more candidates who will be running in the July 10 general election.

In all, the Workers' Party will be fielding 21 candidates in six constituencies at the upcoming polls - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each for Hougang and Punggol West SMCs.

New faces include economist Jamus Jerome Lim Chee Wui, 44, and social activist Raeesah Begum Farid Khan, who is the party's youngest candidate at 26 and the daughter of former presidential aspirant Farid Khan.

Dr Lim, an associate professor of economics at the Essec Business School, said he wanted to take up issues relating to Singapore's ""pressure cooker"" of an education system, which he said has not produced the opportunities and wages it promised.

Ms Khan said she is running to empower marginalised groups. ""What we deserve is a country where the marginalised are cared for, including senior citizens and people with disabilities. We have a right to accessible housing for all, to a low cost of living, to better protection for workers.""

She added that during the circuit breaker, she reached out to single mothers living in the Sengkang area to offer support and distribute milk formula and groceries.

The other candidates are familiar faces who have stood in previous general elections.

Shipping lawyer Dennis Tan, 49, whose candidacy was announced yesterday, said: ""My years as an NCMP has made me even more convinced that PAP's super majority in Parliament is bad for Singapore and bad for Singaporeans. In the post-Covid-19 years ahead with likely deglobalisation, it will be a brave new world and no ruling party can say it has been there before. We therefore need more diversity of ideas and less groupthink in Parliament.""

The other two are Mr Dylan Ng, 44, who works in the finance in-dustry; and Mr Ron Tan, 35, who works in a healthcare institution's research office. In 2015, Mr Ng contested Marine Parade GRC, while Mr Tan was fielded in Nee Soon GRC.

Mr Ng said: ""Political competition will bring out the best in people, regardless of the party they come from. Coming forward to serve and to provide more choices for Singaporeans is the right thing for me to do.""

Mr Tan, who is Mr Low's legislative assistant, said young Singaporeans should step up to be the voice for their seniors, cohort and children. ""Their choices and their actions will shape and change how Singapore is and will be for themselves and for their family in the future,"" said Mr Tan, who is married with a daughter.

More candidates will be introduced at the weekend, along with the WP manifesto. In all, the party will be fielding 21 candidates in six constituencies at the upcoming polls - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each for Hougang and Punggol West SMCs.

In 2015, it fielded 28 candidates in 10 constituencies.

Mr Tan is no stranger to politics. In the 2015 General Election, he lost in Fengshan single-member constituency but was one of the best-performing losing opposition candidates with a respectable 42.5 per cent of the votes.

The shipping lawyer with his own firm became a Non-Constituency MP and has spoken up on various issues, especially those related to transport, and the maritime and air transport industries.

""We need a much more balanced Parliament with constructive elected opposition to deal with important issues affecting Singaporeans such as jobs, fair hiring, cost of living, retirement adequacy and the future economy,"" he said yesterday.

Mr Tan will be defending the WP's stronghold in Hougang SMC, which he said knows better than any other constituency in Singapore how important it is to have an alternative voice in Parliament. The seat has been held by the Workers' Party since 1991.

""We're very grateful to Hougang voters all these years for their support for the Workers' Party. And all I would say in a humble way is that I will do my best to win the mandate of the Hougang voters again,"" said Mr Tan, who is married with a four-year-old daughter.

Even though Dr Lim has spent many years of his life in an academic setting, school was not a breeze.

""But what I went through, really, is nothing compared to the pressure cooker that kids today must endure,"" said Dr Lim, one of two new candidates introduced by the Workers' Party yesterday.

Singapore may have one of the world's best performing school systems, he said, but there are still graduates who are choosing jobs with little or no future, or are dissatisfied with their career trajectories.

""I believe that we have allowed superficial success in our educational system to blind us to the fact that... our education system is not preparing our children to take on and create good jobs for the future,"" said Dr Lim, who is married with an eight-month-old daughter.

""I do not wish to leave a legacy where the next generation feels unprepared to confront the future, even though it has done exactly all that we have asked it to do.""

Such difficult questions, he said, can be resolved only with a healthy, active and honest debate in Parliament.

Mr Ng entered politics in 2015 and was fielded as a Workers' Party candidate in Marine Parade GRC.

It was the first time since Singapore's inde-pendence that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) was challenged for every available seat in Parliament.

Looking back on the years when many constituencies went unchallenged, the last thing Mr Ng wants to see is the return of walkover victories for the PAP.

""To me, Nomination Day is more important than Polling Day.

""I think (walkovers) are not healthy for the political landscape in Singapore,"" he said at a press conference yesterday.

Mr Ng, a Christian, is married with two children, and has 20 years of experience in the banking and finance sector.

He said he spent the circuit breaker period helping a non-governmental organisation distribute laptops islandwide to households with children who needed them for home-based learning.

He was coy when asked if he would return to Marine Parade to try again this year.

""I will leave it to the party to decide, and you will know in a few days' time,"" he said.

Involved in student politics since she was 17, as well as civil society groups, she said she understands the concerns of young people.

Married with an infant son, Ms Khan is the daughter of former presidential aspirant Farid Khan, with whom she says she shares a love for public service.

""We also always have a lot of discussions about the things that affect our community, so it's always great to have his listening ear,"" she said.

Ms Khan has also made a name for herself as the founder and chief executive of the Reyna Movement, an organisation operating in Singapore and Johor to empower marginalised women and children through upskilling programmes and community engagement.

She said: ""I'm very passionate about workers' rights, and I'm very passionate about people having a decent living wage and being able to live with dignity.""

Mr Tan has been active in community events for the past nine years.

He was part of a WP team that went up against the ruling People's Action Party in Nee Soon GRC in 2015. After they lost, Mr Tan did not let up on his outreach efforts.

Since 2017, he has served as legislative assistant to former WP chief Low Thia Khiang .

Mr Tan, who has a double degree in law and commerce from the University of Western Australia, said he has learnt important lessons about being an MP from Mr Low, including that an MP must serve his residents.

""You're elected to take on the responsibility to look after them, to manage the estate, to be their voice in Parliament and to assist them with their day-to-day issues."" Even on simple issues like fixing corridor lights, Mr Low would personally follow up to ensure they were resolved, he said.

""The best lesson I learnt from him is that you have to be responsible to your residents,"" he said.

Party chief Pritam Singh said there would be no further changes to the team following his announcement a day earlier that former party chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwart Chen Show Mao would not contest the election.

Mr Singh, party chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap will defend their seats in the election. Mr Gerald Giam, who was an NCMP from 2011 to 2015, and Mr Leon Perera, who became an NCMP after the 2015 polls, will replace Mr Low and Mr Chen.

There had been speculation that Ms Lim might be fielded in a different constituency.

During the press conference, the party also introduced five more candidates who will be running in the July 10 general election.

New faces include economist Jamus Lim, 44, and social activist Raeesah Begum Farid Khan, who is the party's youngest candidate at 26 and the daughter of former presidential aspirant Farid Khan.

The other candidates are familiar faces who stood in previous general elections.

Shipping lawyer and NCMP Dennis Tan, 49, will be the party's candidate for the Hougang single-member constituency (SMC).

The other two are Mr Dylan Ng, 44, who works in the finance industry; and Mr Ron Tan, 35, who works in a healthcare institution's research office.

This is the second round of introductions by the party. More candidates will be introduced at the weekend, along with the WP manifesto.

The WP on Thursday introduced four candidates, including two new faces.

Research analyst at an investment bank Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, and Mr Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34, a gig-economy worker, will be running in the general election for the first time.

The other two are familiar faces on the campaign trail. They are education entrepreneur Yee Jenn Jong, 55, who was an NCMP from 2011 to 2015, and Ms Nicole Seah, 33, an associate director in a multinational marketing firm who has been volunteering with the WP since 2015. She was a National Solidarity Party candidate in the 2011 election.

In all, the WP will be fielding 21 candidates in six constituencies at the coming polls - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each in Hougang and Punggol West SMCs.

WP chief Pritam Singh on Friday (June 26) confirmed the line-up of candidates to defend the lone group representation constituency held by an opposition party.

Mr Singh, party chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap will be joined by former Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) Gerald Giam and Leon Perera, who will replace former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwart Chen Show Mao, the party said on Friday, amid speculation there might be further changes to the team.

WP had on Thursday announced that Mr Low, the longest-serving opposition MP in Parliament, Mr Chen and incumbent Hougang SMC MP Png Eng Huat will not stand for election this time, in line with its leadership renewal plans.

Party organising secretary Dennis Tan, who became an NCMP after the 2015 election, will stand in Hougang SMC.

At Friday's press conference, WP also introduced five more candidates who will be running in the July 10 general election, adding to the four names that were unveiled on Thursday.

Here is a look at the candidates' profiles:

DENNIS TAN LIP FONG, 49

Lawyer and founding partner at shipping law firm DennisMathiew

Mr Tan is no stranger to politics. In the 2015 General Election, he lost in Fengshan single-member constituency but was one of the best-performing losing opposition candidates with a respectable 42.5 per cent of the votes.

The shipping lawyer with his own firm became a Non-Constituency MP and has spoken up on various issues, especially those related to transport, and the maritime and air transport industries.

""We need a much more balanced Parliament with constructive elected opposition to deal with important issues affecting Singaporeans such as jobs, fair hiring, cost of living, retirement adequacy and the future economy,"" he said yesterday.

Mr Tan will be defending the WP's stronghold in Hougang SMC, which he said knows better than any other constituency in Singapore how important it is to have an alternative voice in Parliament. The seat has been held by the Workers' Party since 1991.

""We're very grateful to Hougang voters all these years for their support for the Workers' Party. And all I would say in a humble way is that I will do my best to win the mandate of the Hougang voters again,"" said Mr Tan, who is married with a four-year-old daughter.

DR JAMUS JEROME LIM CHEE WUI, 44

Associate Professor of Economics at Essec Business School

Even though Dr Lim has spent many years of his life in an academic setting, school was not a breeze.

""But what I went through, really, is nothing compared to the pressure cooker that kids today must endure,"" said Dr Lim, one of two new candidates introduced by the Workers' Party yesterday.

Singapore may have one of the world's best performing school systems, he said, but there are still graduates who are choosing jobs with little or no future, or are dissatisfied with their career trajectories.

""I believe that we have allowed superficial success in our educational system to blind us to the fact that... our education system is not preparing our children to take on and create good jobs for the future,"" said Dr Lim, who is married with an eight-month-old daughter.

""I do not wish to leave a legacy where the next generation feels unprepared to confront the future, even though it has done exactly all that we have asked it to do.""

Such difficult questions, he said, can be resolved only with a healthy, active and honest debate in Parliament.

DYLAN NG FOO ENG, 44

Director in a wealth advisory firm



ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG



Mr Ng entered politics in 2015 and was fielded as a Workers' Party candidate in Marine Parade GRC.

It was the first time since Singapore's inde-pendence that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) was challenged for every available seat in Parliament.

Looking back on the years when many constituencies went unchallenged, the last thing Mr Ng wants to see is the return of walkover victories for the PAP.

""To me, Nomination Day is more important than Polling Day.

""I think (walkovers) are not healthy for the political landscape in Singapore,"" he said at a press conference yesterday.

Mr Ng, a Christian, is married with two children, and has 20 years of experience in the banking and finance sector.

He said he spent the circuit breaker period helping a non-governmental organisation distribute laptops islandwide to households with children who needed them for home-based learning.

He was coy when asked if he would return to Marine Parade to try again this year.

""I will leave it to the party to decide, and you will know in a few days' time,"" he said.

LOUIS CHUA KHENG WEE, 33

Equity research analyst with a global investment bank

As an equity research analyst with a global investment bank, Mr Chua advises investors on whether they should put money in a particular company.

His work has taught him the value of transparency, disclosure requirements, and the presence of external parties, such as regulators and an independent board of directors, to ensure proper corporate governance.

""It is with this understanding that I strongly believe that a monopoly in government is never a good thing without an effective opposition in Parliament,"" said Mr Chua, one of two new candidates introduced yesterday by the Workers' Party.

Mr Chua has a degree in accountancy from the Singapore Management University and is a qualified chartered accountant.

Building a more resilient society means recognising that dissenting views should not only be accepted but also encouraged, he said.

""This will ensure that we come up with the best ideas to take Singapore forward,"" said Mr Chua, who is married with a nine-month-old son.

He said: ""I really care deeply for the future of Singapore that my son will grow up in.""

NICOLE SEAH, 33

Associate director at a multinational marketing group

Ms Seah is a familiar face on the campaign trail, having been the star candidate of the National Solidarity Party (NSP) in the 2011 General Election. She did not run in 2015, but will this time as a candidate for the Workers' Party.

At a virtual press conference yesterday, the associate director at a multinational marketing group said she recognised that returning to the political scene would mean increased scrutiny.

""To be honest, I'm having a very stable career right now; my personal life is in a very good state,"" she said. ""But I do it for the party, because I believe in the leadership and I believe in the vision, and I do it for my daughter.""

Ms Seah, who is married with a one-year-old daughter, added: ""I want to leave behind a legacy for her where she would feel comfortable regardless of the political inclinations or the kinds of views that she's expressing.""

Ms Seah, who resigned from the NSP in 2014 and has volunteered with the Workers' Party since 2015, said she was drawn to the ethos of the party, which believes in ""building a strong and reasonable opposition that contributes to our political landscape in Singapore in a constructive manner"".

MUHAMMAD AZHAR ABDUL LATIP, 34

Grab driver and small business owner





PHOTO: WORKERS' PARTY



Mr Azhar lost his left leg in a road traffic accident in 2014.

And the experience of having a disability highlighted for him the need for a more inclusive society in Singapore - a cause he hopes to champion if elected to Parliament.

""We want to be an inclusive society, but when it comes to the disabled groups, it tends to be... lip service,"" said Mr Azhar, who was one of two first-time candidates introduced yesterday by the Workers' Party.

Mr Azhar, who has volunteered at food distribution and community outreach programmes in Aljunied GRC, holds a political science degree from the National University of Singapore.

He was a marine insurance broker with an international brokerage when the accident occurred.

He is now a Grab driver and small-business owner.

Mr Azhar, who is divorced with a child, said: ""That is one thing I would like to change in society... (I want to help) disabled groups to make sure they are being assisted, that those who want to work are given equal opportunities for employment and receive the help they deserve.""

YEE JENN JONG, 55

Entrepreneur





PHOTO: WORKERS' PARTY



Mr Yee ran and lost to candidates from the ruling People's Action Party in the general elections in 2011 and 2015.

On July 10, he will stand for the third time as a candidate for the Workers' Party, because he believes Singapore needs a strong alternative in Parliament.

""Only when there's competition would the PAP listen to you,"" said Mr Yee at a press conference yesterday. ""In business, we need anti-monopoly laws to keep companies from taking advantage of consumers and to keep on innovating. The same goes for politics as well.""

In 2011, Mr Yee narrowly lost to Mr Charles Chong of the PAP in Joo Chiat SMC with 48.99 per cent of the vote.

The SMC was absorbed into Marine Parade GRC in 2015, and Mr Yee was fielded as part of the Workers' Party slate of five candidates then. The party garnered 35.9 per cent of votes.

Mr Yee said he continues to be active on the ground, and has initiated community projects in Marine Parade GRC, such as distributing food to lower-income families since the start of the circuit breaker.

TERENCE TAN LI-CHERN, 48

Lawyer



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



Mr Tan is a litigation lawyer who has been volunteering with the WP since 2011. He is married and has two sons.

In his electoral debut in 2015, the WP team in Marine Parade GRC garnered 35.9 per cent of the votes against the incumbent PAP team led by former prime minister Goh Chok Tong.

Mr Tan said yesterday that what he hopes to achieve in politics has not changed. ""I hope to ensure that the interests of Singaporeans are always placed at the very forefront of the Government's policies.

""Covid-19 has stress-tested the resilience of our economy and our savings. Singaporeans are understandably anxious for their families.""

Singapore faces ""many perils ahead"" and it needs a more diverse and inclusive Parliament with constructive and robust debates, he added.

""I appeal to Singaporeans to consider whether we should continue down the same path without at least appointing a few people to call out instances where the emperor may not wear clothes.""

KENNETH FOO SECK GUAN, 42

Deputy director at Singapore Cancer Society



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



In 2015, Mr Foo ran on the Workers' Party ticket in Nee Soon GRC. With 33.2 per cent of the vote, his team lost.

He became the party's deputy organising secretary in 2016, and served in that role until 2018.

Last year, he became a legislative assistant to Aljunied GRC MP and WP chairman Sylvia Lim.

In this capacity, he has been very busy over the past few weeks, as residents have been asking for help to apply for various grants and schemes to tide them over the Covid-19 period, he said yesterday.

He said: ""In the midst of Covid-19, we're calling an election. A lot of things must be going through the residents' minds: Why am I having an election at this time? But I'm not there to help them answer that.

""In fact, I'll put that question back to them to say it is a good question that you might need us to go into Parliament to help to ask.""

On the topic of transparency, he said that WP MPs have filed many parliamentary questions about key statistics that affect Singaporeans' lives.

""Some got answered. Some were half-answered. Some got no answer at all,"" said Mr Foo.

""I find this situation totally unacceptable, and we need to have a strong opposition presence in Parliament to hold the Government accountable for its actions.""

NATHANIEL KOH KIM KUI, 36

Digital product owner at a multinational organisation



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



For the past five years, Mr Nathaniel Koh was the friendly face greeting those who turned up at the Meet-the-People sessions of Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh.

Yesterday, he was unveiled as one of the new faces the party will field this election.

Mr Koh, who was described as a ""GE veteran"" by WP party chairman Sylvia Lim yesterday, was an election agent and volunteer for the campaign of WP Sengkang West candidate Koh Choon Yong in 2011 and 2015.

Explaining why he decided to take the plunge as a candidate only now, after having been in the party since 2009, he said: ""I am standing in this election as a continuation of my journey to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, to help put Singapore on the clearer path to navigate the challenges ahead, and to make Singapore better than it is today.""

If elected, he said he hopes to champion the cause of young families.

Mr Koh, whose wife is expecting their first child, said he wanted to reduce the obstacles that young parents face in caring for their children by looking at social and not just financial incentives.

MUHAMMAD FADLI MOHAMMED FAWZI, 40

Lawyer with Inkwell Law Corporation



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



It was a soft spot for the underdog that got Mr Muhammad Fadli interested in opposition politics.

""We would always fight hard but always lose. But when we won, such as in Aljunied in 2011, it was something special. I guess I saw part of myself in that struggle - always having to fight harder and facing more difficulties to earn your place in the world,"" he said yesterday.

""But, to be honest, I would have it no other way.""

Having graduated from the National University of Singapore with a master's degree in sociology, Mr Muhammad Fadli worked for five years at the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. He went on to earn a Juris Doctor from the Singapore Management University.

Yesterday, he said: ""Many voters are sometimes afraid to vote for us, thinking that having more opposition will weaken the country. But this is exactly the opposite. When the Workers' Party speaks out, we are speaking out on behalf of Singaporeans who, for one reason or the other, feel that they are being left behind as the country moves forward.""

He added that with the WP in Parliament, the Government would be more responsive, and ""when we speak truth to power, we do so constructively because we believe that only by doing so can we make Singapore the inclusive and resilient country that each and every Singapore citizen deserves"".

TAN CHEN CHEN, 38

Contracts administrator working on energy and chemical projects



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



Ms Tan Chen Chen may not have been a top student when she was in school, but she hopes that voters will give her a chance as she is ""willing to work hard and against the odds for what she wants"".

Since 2015, she has been volunteering at the Bedok Reservoir-Punggol ward of Aljunied GRC, helping out at the Meet-the-People sessions of former Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang.

Yesterday, as she was introduced as the WP's new face, she said in Mandarin: ""I hope there can be more (opposition MPs) in Parliament who will speak up on behalf of the people and help improve their lives, and not just oppose for the sake of opposing.""

She urged young Singaporeans to take an interest in politics, as it is necessary for them to chart their future.

The mother of a three-month-old child said the affordability of housing for young people is an issue close to her heart. She estimated that after buying a flat in a non-mature estate, a young couple will have to spend the next 30 years or so paying off the mortgage. ""By the time they reach 55, there will not be much left in their Central Provident Fund. How will we enjoy life?

Many in single-seat Hougang, where Mr Low, 63, was first elected as MP in 1991 and served the constituency for 20 years, still remember him with great fondness and said it was painful to see him call time on his political career as Singapore's longest-serving opposition MP.

Said long-time Hougang resident Andy Teo, 81: ""He's a very good man, I've met him before. He's a very compassionate and straightforward man.""

Added the part-time cleaner: ""I hope he stays on as an adviser to the party. I think the newer group will be missing something without him, so hopefully he will still be able to help them in other ways.""

Mr Mark Ong, 53, who has been living in Hougang Avenue 2 since he was 21, was also disappointed by the news. But the engineer said that with or without Mr Low, whom he called an ""opposition idol"", he would continue to support the WP.

Mr Ong recalled the time Mr Low visited Mr Ong's father's wake and sent the family a wreath of flowers to express his condolences, something the four-term Hougang MP did for bereaved families in his ward.

""A lot of people say Mr Low is an angry man but he is really friendly. He stands up for Singaporeans,"" Mr Ong added.

But those interviewed by The Straits Times also felt that the next generation of WP politicians were ready to step up to the plate.

Administrative officer Ranjit Singh, 56, said he understands the reason for Mr Low retiring from politics, given his age and recent fall.

Said the Hougang resident of seven years: ""He's been around for quite a while. He might be a bit tired. It's also a chance for new blood to come in and have a chance to lead.""

Besides Mr Low, who was an MP for Aljunied GRC, two other WP MPs in the 13th Parliament are also not contesting the July 10 polls. The duo are Mr Png Eng Huat, 58, who had been Hougang MP since 2012, and Mr Chen Show Mao, 59, who was an MP for Aljunied GRC.

A 29-year-old resident, who wanted to be known only as Andy, said he was more shocked to hear Mr Png was leaving after just two terms. But, the technician added: ""It is quite true that the party needs to be renewed. Everything is changing so it is good to have some younger people come in, because different generations have different views.""

Political observers said the WP's chances would likely not be affected by the changes.

Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said Hougang is still very much synonymous with Mr Low and as long as his presence is felt there, it is a constituency that the WP will win. ""It doesn't really matter if you change the candidates there, so long as they're from WP.""

He also said the WP has an advantage as the incumbent in Hougang and Aljunied and it will bank on that and the fact that it still has good people to govern the constituencies. ""All of these things are going to matter more than just who is stepping down and who's going to replace them.""

Former Nominated MP Zulkifli Baharudin said Mr Low's personality and his background resonated with residents in Hougang and Aljunied GRC. ""For people who have voted for him because he speaks their language and is very much their kind of man, it is going to be a lasting influence.""

While Mr Zulkifli said it is important for Mr Low to continue to give moral support to the WP and its candidates, he added that all political parties have to go through renewal.

""It is a big loss for sure. But the nature of political parties is such that they... must be able to transform.""

In addition to defending Aljunied GRC, which it first won in 2011, and its north-eastern bastion of Hougang SMC, the party said it will also contest in Marine Parade GRC, Sengkang GRC, East Coast GRC and Punggol West SMC.

WP chief Pritam Singh announced this at a virtual press conference yesterday, during which the party leaders also introduced four candidates.

Two of them were new candidates: Mr Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, a research analyst at an investment bank, and Mr Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34, a gig-economy worker who lost his left leg in an accident in 2014.

The third candidate introduced yesterday was Ms Nicole Seah, 33, an associate director at a multinational marketing firm. Ms Seah was a National Solidarity Party candidate in the 2011 election but quit in 2014 and began volunteering with WP the following year.

The final candidate introduced was education entrepreneur Yee Jenn Jong, 55, who was a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) from 2011 to 2015.

At the briefing, Mr Singh also announced that former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwarts Chen Show Mao and Png Eng Huat will not stand for election this time, in line with the party's leadership renewal plans.

In all, the WP will field 21 candidates in six constituencies - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each for the two SMCs.

In 2015, it fielded 28 candidates in 10 constituencies - its largest slate since the election in 1988.

Asked why the party was contesting fewer seats this time, Mr Singh said the party wanted to field its best candidates.

He said: ""We want them to represent Singapore, and to represent them well. If we can find more candidates, of course, we can consider fielding more seats.""

He added: ""It's important to focus our efforts and ensure that the candidates that we put forward can do well for the Workers' Party.""

Taking Mr Low's and Mr Chen's places in the Aljunied GRC team are two members who have been NCMPs. Mr Gerald Giam was an NCMP from 2011 to 2015 and Mr Leon Perera became an NCMP after the 2015 polls.

Party organising secretary Dennis Tan, who also became an NCMP after the 2015 election, will stand in Hougang SMC, Mr Singh said.

The WP will introduce more candidates today and at the weekend.

Mr Singh said that while this would be his first general election as secretary-general of the party, he has taken part in two general elections and two by-elections in other capacities.

He said: ""At every election, the Workers' Party fights hard and seeks to persuade Singaporeans to cast their vote, make their vote count and cast it for the Workers' Party.""

This is because the party wants to serve as a credible opposition in Parliament, he said.

""That means bringing a rational and responsible debate into Parliament, so as to represent the interests of all Singaporeans,"" he added.

Mr Singh said that GE2020 will be ""a tough general election"", but added that he and the other members of his party are looking forward to it.

And the experience of having a disability highlighted for him the need for a more inclusive society in Singapore - a cause he hopes to champion if elected to Parliament.

""We want to be an inclusive society, but when it comes to the disabled groups, it tends to be... lip service,"" said Mr Azhar, who was one of two first-time candidates introduced yesterday by the Workers' Party.

Mr Azhar, who has volunteered at food distribution and community outreach programmes in Aljunied GRC, holds a political science degree from the National University of Singapore.

He was a marine insurance broker with an international brokerage when the accident occurred.

He is now a Grab driver and small business owner.

Mr Azhar, who is divorced with a child, said: ""That is one thing I would like to change in society... (I want to help) disabled groups to make sure they are being assisted, that those who want to work are given equal opportunities for employment and receive the help they deserve.""

Mr Yee Jenn Jong ran and lost to candidates from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in the 2011 and 2015 general elections.

On July 10, he will stand for the third time as a candidate for the Workers' Party (WP), because he believes Singapore needs a strong alternative in Parliament.

""Only when there's competition would the PAP listen to you,"" said Mr Yee at a press conference yesterday. ""In business, we need anti-monopoly laws to keep companies from taking advantage of consumers and to keep on innovating. The same goes for politics as well.""

In 2011, Mr Yee narrowly lost to Mr Charles Chong of the PAP in Joo Chiat SMC with 48.99 per cent of the vote.

The single-member constituency was absorbed into Marine Parade GRC in 2015, and Mr Yee was fielded as part of the WP's slate of five candidates then. The WP garnered 35.9 per cent of votes.

Mr Yee said he continues to be active on the ground, and has initiated community projects in Marine Parade GRC, such as distributing food to lower-income families since the start of the circuit breaker.

The man who helmed the WP for 17 years told The Straits Times yesterday that he decided not to stand in the coming general election as he felt his work was done.

As party chief, he had achieved the twin goals he had set for himself after taking over from the party's firebrand leader J.B. Jeyaretnam in 2001.

The first was to secure a group representation constituency for the WP, which he did in 2011.

That year, he famously left his long-time Hougang constituency to lead a team to victory in Aljunied GRC, the first and only time an opposition party had won in a GRC.

The second was to renew the ranks of the WP, and hand over to a new generation of younger leaders. Over the years, he has made a concerted effort to attract and field younger members in their 30s and 40s. In 2018, Mr Low stepped down as secretary-general, making way for Mr Pritam Singh, 43.

In his first interview since his retirement from electoral politics was announced, Mr Low told ST and other media: ""I hope that the Workers' Party itself has that spirit. The whole organisation's formation and process is important, and not just an individual... I have always maintained that a party cannot depend on just an individual or a few individuals.""

It was also the first time that he was speaking to the media after a bad fall at his Upper Thomson home in April left him with traumatic brain injury.

His condition has since improved after being discharged from hospital on May 21, and he appears none the worse for wear.

But the fall he suffered when on the way to the bathroom has left a lasting injury to his olfactory nerve centre, robbing him of his sense of smell and the enjoyment he used to get from a steaming bowl of laksa.

""Laksa has many layers to it, now I can only taste that it is spicy and salty,"" he said, chuckling.

He was quick to add that it was a small price to pay. ""Such a bad fall could have been very, very serious, but now I am mostly OK. If I have lost my sense of smell, it is a small thing, so be it,"" added Mr Low, who has been given medical leave until July 15.

Throughout his political career, the Teochew-speaking businessman can be said to have tasted, in Chinese parlance, ""sourness, sweetness, bitterness and heat"".

His experiences as a student at Nanyang University, which was made to merge with the University of Singapore, and later as a teacher who saw students from poorer backgrounds struggling, left him sour and disillusioned.

It pushed him onto the path of politics, which he felt was the only way to change people's lives.

The WP that he joined in 1982 was more focused on issues like human rights and took a more adversarial approach towards the Government, under Mr Jeyaretnam. The party then was plagued by the same problems that other opposition parties faced, with infighting and an inability to attract good candidates.

But under Mr Low, who was elected party chief in 2001, it has taken a different direction, focusing on issues of the day and creating a brand of constructive politics that strives to provide a check in Parliament.

In 2011, Mr Low described the WP as a co-driver that would slap the driver, the PAP, if the ruling party were to go off course in governing the country.

His more pragmatic and moderate line has won credibility with the middle ground, gaining the party a broader base of supporters and also a new generation of members, with not a few lawyers, bankers and academics.

On this front, he feels that the party has evolved even more with its new, younger leadership.

""Probably they are a different generation in terms of political debates. I would think that I'm more aggressive, but the younger generation like Pritam and Leon, maybe they want a different approach, which I think is not a bad thing,"" he said referring to Mr Singh and NonConstituency MP Leon Perera.

""If I compare myself with my predecessor Jeyaretnam, I think I am probably mild, right? So probably this political progress, where you become less aggressive and you can sit down and talk about things rather than just political brickbats, is a good thing.""

Asked about how he would rate Mr Singh's leadership so far, Mr Low said: ""So far, I think Pritam has been good in that from my observation (he has) done well in exchanges with the ministers.""

He added that this was true of the party's other MPs as well, as ""they respond appropriately and they make a point although they don't go for some attack here and there like me"".

The sweet taste of victory in Aljunied GRC in 2011, did not last long, and after that general election, the WP's Aljunied-Hougang Town Council got embroiled in a saga over its accounts.

Observers say this contributed to some extent to the WP's more dismal showing in Aljunied GRC in 2015, when the team scraped by with 50.96 per cent of the votes.

The town council, through an independent panel, had successfully sued the party's MPs, including Mr Low, over more than $33 million in improper payments. Mr Low and party chairman Sylvia Lim were found by the High Court to have breached their fiduciary duties.

In his ruling, the High Court judge said the two Aljunied GRC MPs had acted dishonestly when they awarded a managing agent contract to a company set up by their supporters without calling a tender. He added that in doing so, they had put their own political interests above the interests of their residents.

Mr Low, along with the other MPs and town councillors, have appealed against the ruling.

Having been an opposition Parliament member for so long, Mr Low has taken some heat from the ruling party. But he is also one of few opposition politicians who have drawn admiration from both sides of the aisle.

Yesterday, asked if the party would lose some of its shine without him contesting, Mr Low, who is Singapore's most successful opposition politician to date, quipped: ""I do not know how many voters vote solely because of me.""

He sought to dismiss the notion that the WP is the ""Low Thia Khiang party"", adding that it has evolved since he was first elected into Parliament and became the party's only representative in the House.

In the past term of Parliament, the WP had a team of six MPs and three NCMPs, and people would judge the party based on their performance and their interactions with voters too, he added.

Asked how he would like his political career to be remembered, Mr Low said: ""I do not have this hope that others will (remember me in any particular way). I have done what I should do, I have no regrets. Of course everyone will have different views. And as a public figure you have to accept them. That's all. I would not be surprised if someone is scolding me; I accept it.

""I will remember the people, the voters. I think these are important life assets, friends in Hougang. I will remember them.""",0.40127096861471867,0.08529558982683982,Positive

Taking Mr Low's and Mr Chen's place in the Aljunied GRC slate will be Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Leon Perera, while Mr Png will be replaced in Hougang by Mr Dennis Tan.

WP secretary-general Pritam Singh made the announcement yesterday at the party's first press conference in this election, confirming speculation that had been swirling on the ground that the three stalwarts have asked to sit out the election.

Describing it as a collective decision anchored on the continued success of the WP, Mr Singh said the move would allow the party to broaden its leadership base and also remain in touch with the ground as Singapore's population changes.

""For the party to grow, new and younger leaders require parliamentary and town council experience. If there is no renewal of Workers' Party MPs, over time, the party will not be able to attract new members to join and aspire to serve Singapore and Singaporeans as opposition MPs.

""The absence of new blood will set the party back in its growth as a credible and institutionalised opposition in Singapore,"" he said.

He added that Mr Low, 63, himself had persuaded him on the importance of refreshing the party's line-up of MPs for the WP to remain relevant to all Singaporeans.

""He was concerned that as the elder generation of the party ages, even as values and wisdom remain timeless, a Member of Parliament must have his or her pulse on Singapore society.

""If a Workers' Party MP becomes too detached from new norms and the changing shape of society, the Workers' Party will be less effective in speaking for Singaporeans in Parliament and run the risk of becoming irrelevant,"" Mr Singh said, relating Mr Low's advice.

All three men had expressed their wish to step down at the end of this term of Parliament and Mr Singh stressed that this ""is not a retirement"". He said the trio will continue to mentor and train the party's next-generation leaders.

""The time is right for the Workers' Party to have senior leaders contribute in a different capacity. They remain critical as the party's resource of information and experience,"" Mr Singh added.

ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH For the party to grow, new and younger leaders require parliamentary and town council experience. If there is no renewal of Workers' Party MPs, over time, the party will not be able to attract new members to join and aspire to serve Singapore and Singaporeans as opposition MPs. The absence of new blood will set the party back in its growth as a credible and institutionalised opposition in Singapore. MR PRITAM SINGH, secretary-general of the Workers' Party.

Mr Low's candidacy in Aljunied had been unclear after he sustained a head injury from a fall at home on April 30. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and discharged after 21 days.

He is recovering and a recent photograph posted by People's Action Party (PAP) member and Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin showed him in good spirits. But some party members had said Mr Low was contemplating stepping down even before the accident.

The battle-hardened politician, known for his Teochew rally speeches and down-to-earth manner, joined politics some 40 years ago. He has been an elected MP for 29 years - the longest-serving opposition MP in Singapore.

First elected into Parliament in Hougang in 1991, he left the constituency in 2011 to lead a team to victory in Aljunied GRC, and in recent years has called on voters to help the party renew its ranks by voting in its younger members.

Under him, the WP became the first opposition party to win a group representation constituency.

Another of his big achievements as party chief was attracting Mr Chen, 59, a top corporate lawyer, to its ranks. With his credentials, Mr Chen was seen as the type of star catch that only the PAP would field, and his candidacy with the WP in 2011 is thought to have played a critical part in securing a win in Aljunied GRC.

Meanwhile, Mr Png, 58, who joined WP in 2006, was first fielded as a candidate in 2011 in East Coast GRC, but did not win. He was fielded again as the party's candidate in the Hougang by-election in 2012, and has been an MP in the ward since then.

The three younger candidates who will be taking their place - Mr Giam, 42, Mr Perera, 48, and Mr Tan, 49 - have all had parliamentary experience as Non-Constituency MPs and have been touted as its next-generation leaders.

Mr Perera has been shadowing Ms Lim in her Serangoon ward in Aljunied GRC for the past few years, while Mr Tan has been shadowing Mr Png in Hougang.

Meanwhile, Mr Giam has been spotted walking the ground in Mr Low's Bedok Reservoir-Punggol ward, and has been knocking on doors and giving out fliers with his photo, name and contact number to residents in the area.

Thanking the three senior leaders, Mr Singh said: ""The Workers' Party and our supporters have been fortunate to count on the leadership of Mr Low, Mr Chen and Mr Png for many years. And many Singaporeans are in their debt for their decision to serve the country through the Workers' Party.

""The party leadership, chair Sylvia Lim and myself, and all of us at the Workers' Party will continue working and walking together, standing on the shoulders of the values Mr Low and other elder members have built. We will strengthen and carry the Workers' Party forward to greater heights.""

News of the three stalwarts stepping down yesterday eclipsed the party's first candidate introduction session, which saw two new faces and two familiar faces announced.

The first two new candidates unveiled were equity analyst Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, and Grab driver and small business owner Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34.

The party will also be fielding its former NCMP and two-time candidate Yee Jenn Jong, 55, as well as advertising executive Nicole Seah, 33, who had contested the 2011 election with the National Solidarity Party.

Mr Singh, who was joined by party chairman Sylvia Lim at the press conference held over the Zoom videoconferencing application, did not say where the candidates would be fielded.

But Mr Yee, who had contested in Joo Chiat SMC in 2011 and Marine Parade GRC in 2015, said he was ""back for a third time"", signalling his likely candidacy in the GRC.

Mr Singh said the upcoming election, held amid the coronavirus pandemic, would present challenges for the WP, which has typically held large mass rallies to get its message out.

""The upcoming election will be a tough and challenging one for the Workers' Party. Arising from Covid-19, physical rallies will no longer take place. The party will proceed to campaign as best as we can focusing on walking the coffee shops and markets during campaigning, abiding by the safe distancing requirements of the authorities,"" he said.",0.392266510085659,0.11648667526327101,Positive

Many in single-seat Hougang, where Mr Low, 63, was first elected as MP in 1991 and served the constituency for 20 years, still remember him with great fondness and said it was painful to see him call time on his political career as Singapore longest-serving opposition MP.

Said long-time Hougang resident Andy Teo, 81: ""He's a very good man, I've met him before. He's a very compassionate and straightforward man.""

Added the part-time cleaner: ""I hope he stays on as an adviser to the party. I think the newer group will be missing something without him, so hopefully he will still be able to help them in other ways.""

Mr Mark Ong, 53, who has been living in Hougang Avenue 2 since he was 21, was also disappointed by the news.

But the engineer said that with or without Mr Low, whom he called an ""opposition idol"", he would continue to support the WP.

Mr Ong recalled the time when Mr Low had visited his father's funeral wake and sent the family a wreath of flowers to express his condolences, something the four-term Hougang MP did for bereaved families in his ward.

""A lot of people say Mr Low is an angry man but he is really friendly. He stands up for Singaporeans,"" Mr Ong added.

But many interviewed by The Straits Times also felt that the next generation of WP politicians was ready to step up to the plate.

Administrative officer Ranjit Singh, 56, said he understands the reason for Mr Low retiring from politics, given his age and recent fall.

Said the Hougang resident of seven years: ""He's been around for quite a while. He might be a bit tired. It's also a chance for new blood to come in and have a chance to lead.""

Besides Mr Low, who is an MP for Aljunied GRC, two other of the WP's MPs are also not contesting the July 10 polls.

The duo are Mr Png Eng Huat, 58, who has been Hougang MP since 2012, and Mr Chen Show Mao, 59, an MP for Aljunied GRC.

A 29-year-old resident, who wanted to be known only as Andy, said he was shocked to hear that Mr Png was leaving after just two terms.

But, the technician added: ""It is quite true that the party needs to be renewed. Everything is changing, so it is good to have some younger people come in because different generations have different views.""

Political observers said the changes are not likely to affect WP's chances at the polls.

Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said Hougang is still very much synonymous with Mr Low and as long as his presence is felt there, it is a constituency the WP will win.

""It doesn't really matter if you change the candidates there, so long as they're from WP.""

Dr Mustafa also said the WP has an advantage being the incumbent in Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC and it will bank on that, and the fact that they still have good people to govern the constituencies.

""All of these things are going to matter more than just who is stepping down and who is going to replace them.""

Former nominated MP Zulkifli Baharudin said WP is very much personified by Mr Low and the residents in Hougang and Aljunied resonated with him and his background.

""For people who have voted for him because he speaks their language and is very much their kind of man, it is going to be a lasting influence.""

While it is important for Mr Low to continue to give moral support to the WP and its candidates, all political parties have to go through renewal, Mr Zulkifli said.

""It is a big loss, for sure. But the nature of political parties is such that they must be able to transform.

WP candidate Nicole Seah, 33, is a familiar face on the campaign trail, having been the star candidate for the National Solidarity Party (NSP) during the 2011 general election. She did not stand in the 2015 general election, but will contest the upcoming polls as a candidate for the WP.

Speaking at a virtual press conference on Thursday, Ms Seah, an associate director at a multinational marketing group, said she recognised that returning to the political scene would mean increased scrutiny.

""To be honest, I'm having a very stable career right now, my personal life is in a very good state,"" she said. ""But I do it for the party, because I believe in the leadership and I believe in the vision, and I do it for my daughter.""

Ms Seah, who is married with a one-year-old daughter, added: ""I want to leave behind a legacy for her where she would feel comfortable regardless of the political inclinations or the kinds of views that she's expressing.""

Ms Seah, who resigned from the NSP in 2014, said she was drawn to the ethos of the WP, which believes in ""building a strong and reasonable opposition that contributes to our political landscape in Singapore in a constructive manner"".

She has been volunteering with the WP since 2015.

Ms Seah said youth employability will be an issue she will champion, noting that some young people are hired on the basis of having more life experience or global exposure.

""This is not available to everyone. And that puts a lot of youth at a disadvantage when they come out into the workforce,"" she said.

We need to make sure that we do our utmost to make them as competitive as possible in a global workforce.""

Mr Yee Jenn Jong, 55, ran and lost to candidates from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in the 2011 and 2015 general elections.

On July 10, he will stand for the third time as a candidate for the WP because he believes Singapore needs a strong alternative in Parliament.

""Only when there's competition would the PAP listen to you,"" said Mr Yee at a press conference on Thursday. ""In business, we need anti-monopoly laws to keep companies from taking advantage of consumers and to keep on innovating. The same goes for politics as well.""

In 2011, Mr Yee narrowly lost to the PAP's Charles Chong in Joo Chiat SMC, with 48.99 per cent of the vote.

The SMC was absorbed into Marine Parade GRC in 2015, and Mr Yee was fielded as part of WP's slate of five candidates then. The WP garnered 35.9 per cent of votes.

Mr Yee said he continues to be active on the ground, and has initiated community projects in Marine Parade GRC, such as distributing food to lower-income families since the start of the circuit breaker.",0.4160133577841912,0.1027866462241462,Positive

They will defend their seats in Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC, and field candidates to contest Marine Parade GRC, Sengkang GRC, East Coast GRC and Punggol West SMC.

Party chief Pritam Singh announced this at a virtual press conference on Thursday (June 25), where the party introduced two new candidates.

The two first-time candidates are research analyst at an investment bank Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, and Mr Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34, a gig economy worker.

They also introduced two candidates that had contested previous elections.

One was Ms Nicole Seah, 33, an associate director in a multinational marketing firm who has been volunteering with the WP since 2015. She was a National Solidarity Party candidate in the 2011 election.

The final candidate introduced was education entrepreneur Yee Jenn Jong, 55, who had been a NCMP from 2011 to 2015.

Asked why the WP was contesting fewer seats this time - 21 compared with 28 in 2015, Mr Singh said the WP has fielded the best candidates that the party could find.

""We want them to represent Singapore, and to represent (Singaporeans) well,"" he said.

""Of course, we can consider fielding more seats,"" he said, but added: ""It's important to focus our efforts and ensure that the candidates that we put forward can do well for the Workers' Party.""

The WP contested 10 constituencies in 2015, fielding 28 candidates. It was their largest slate of candidates since 1988.",0.5060606060606061,0.1632996632996633,Positive

Coming online a day after President Halimah Yacob dissolved Parliament, the six-minute clip features a diverse slate of men and women, including familiar faces such as outgoing Aljunied GRC MPs Sylvia Lim and Pritam Singh, who is also WP chief, as well as outgoing Non-Constituency MPs Dennis Tan and Leon Perera.

Former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian, 41, along with two members of the team that contested the Nee Soon GRC in 2015, sales consultant Cheryl Loh and Aljunied-Hougang Town Council councillor Kenneth Foo, 43, also lend their faces and voices to the video.

The others are new faces who have not been formally unveiled but have been seen at WP events.

They are economist Jamus Lim, 44; social activist Raeesah Khan, 27; lawyer Fadli Fawzi, who is a town councillor at the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council; advertising executive Nicole Seah, 33, who was a National Solidarity Party candidate in the 2011 election; and environmental geographer Yudhishthra Nathan.

Urging Singaporeans to ""make your vote count"", the party members recount their memories of growing up in Singapore, talk about their outreach and efforts on the ground over the years, and highlight the need for more diversity in Parliament.

Much of what is shared are personal reflections.

Ms Khan, who helps out at Meet-the-People sessions as a case writer, said it taught her about the different worries of residents.

She says: ""I think one of the myths in volunteering with WP is that everything is political. This is not the case at all.""

And residents, while initially guarded, are warm and receptive, they say.

Ms Seah recounts how a resident once ran at volunteers with an umbrella while they were out on a house visit.

""We literally thought he was going to attack us,"" she said. But he opened the umbrella and they saw it was emblazoned with the WP logo.

""He was trying to show his support,"" she said.

Ms Seah also pays tribute to WP volunteers for their dedication, saying their efforts in helping out with weekly house visits, walkabouts and other party events have kept her going on a personal level.

While former WP chief Low Thia Khiang, the longest-serving opposition MP in Parliament, does not make a speaking appearance on the video, he is in clips from previous occasions.

Mr Low, 63, was recently discharged from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital after a bad fall in April, and is recovering at home.

The Workers' Party GE2020: Make Your Vote Count follows a 15-second teaser clip that the party uploaded on its social media channels on Tuesday evening.

It also comes before WP is to begin formally introducing candidates today.

The two slickly produced videos are a sign of WP's online strategy in an election where Internet campaigning is expected to play a bigger part, given the safe distancing rules to prevent Covid-19 infections.

Mass rallies are out, and political parties will also have to scale back the scope of their walkabouts in constituencies.

Many will be turning to cyberspace and social media to get their message across to the electorate.

Each candidate will also get airtime on national television.

In calling for the electorate to vote, Mr Singh said: ""Not everything is black and white. When it's too bright, it becomes too blinding for anyone to see properly. Too dark, it will be hard to look for a way around.""

What the WP hopes, said Mr Singh, is to create contrast. ""A balance, so that you can see clearly the road ahead.""",0.33782196969696965,0.05611742424242426,Positive

Mr Tan made the remarks in a Facebook post that also featured a photo of the two men, both wearing face masks.

Mr Low, 63, injured his head in a fall on April 30. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, and discharged after 21 days.

Mr Tan, whose post comes after what appears to be a visit to Mr Low's home, said he had kept in touch with Mr Low since his fall.

He wrote: ""Glad to see Mr Low again. Have kept in touch with him since his fall and am glad to see him in good spirits and recovering. Had a nice long chat on a range of topics.""

Mr Tan also thanked Mr Low for tea and bak chang, or rice dumplings. ""Hope you like the durian and pears, too,"" he added.

The veteran politician is the former secretary-general of the WP, and an outgoing MP for Aljunied GRC. The other outgoing WP MPs in Aljunied GRC had been covering Mr Low's constituency duties after his fall, with help from former Non-Constituency MP Gerald Giam.

Mr Low is the longest-serving opposition MP in Singapore. He entered politics in 1988, and stood for election as a WP candidate in Tiong Bahru GRC but did not win. In 1991, he won the Hougang single-member seat, and has been an MP since.

In 2001, Mr Low took over as WP secretary-general from Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, and led the party for 17 years before stepping down two years ago.

His successor is outgoing Aljunied GRC MP Pritam Singh.

It is unclear if Mr Low will stand for election again in the upcoming polls, which will be held on July 10.

The WP said he is on the mend, but party sources said he was thinking about retirement even before he got injured.",0.3766908212560387,0.09867149758454108,Positive
