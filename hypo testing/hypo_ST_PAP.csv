""These have been very helpful to residents and I hope that we will continue to look at what else needs to be done. When I asked them if these have been adequate, many of them said 'yes', they can feel the flow of benefits,"" he added.

Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, was speaking to reporters after meeting hawkers and residents at Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre in West Coast GRC.

With him were two incumbent members of the People's Action Party (PAP) team, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har.

Mr Heng said his visit was meant to see if the Budget support measures have been working as intended, and if Singaporeans have further concerns. He was glad to hear many people, including stallholders and workers, tell him the financial support has helped.

""A job is the most important thing for our people, because once they have that, it's not just one-time support, but it is a continuous stream of income that you can look forward to,"" said Mr Heng.

""So I'm very glad to see that many of our companies are responding to this, and our workers are keeping their jobs.""

The four Budgets this year will see around $93 billion spent to help companies, workers and households cope with the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, and a key measure is the Jobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers by footing up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of local workers' wages.

Mr Heng also said others told him they were glad to have the Solidarity Payment - $600 in cash for all adult Singaporeans - and Solidarity Utilities Credit scheme, along with service and conservancy charges rebates and income relief for the self-employed. Public agencies are working hard to ensure the schemes reach their intended beneficiaries, he said, adding that the hawkers he met are glad that they get rental waivers for five months, and a range of support measures.

Residents are also coping, he said. ""People are adjusting very well to this new situation. Many of them have told me how they are supporting one another, and this is the neighbourly spirit that we need to develop in our society.""

Mr Heng noted that some companies which have done well during this Covid-19 period have rewarded workers with bonuses, saying more companies should do so.

While most of Singapore's economy has resumed since the second phase of reopening began last Friday, Mr Heng urged caution as the pandemic is still raging globally.

He later visited Causeway Point in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, accompanied by members of the PAP team there, Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad, and will be visiting constituencies islandwide in the coming days.

Meanwhile, asked about the challenge posed by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who is leading a team from the Progress Singapore Party to contest the five-member West Coast GRC, Mr Iswaran noted that other parties have contested the GRC in the past.

""Our message and stance have been consistent. We're focused on improving the lives and livelihoods of our residents. In other words, we want to take care of their needs, we want to enhance their well-being,"" he said.

The focus is on helping residents with immediate challenges posed by the Covid-19 situation, and also prepare for the long term, he said: ""That is our message to our residents, and that is the basis on which we will campaign, and we will stand on our track record.""",0.41785159285159285,0.19815462315462315,Positive

Mr Charles Chong, 67, Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the ruling party's longest-serving backbencher, is retiring after 32 years.

He won by the ""narrowest of margins"" in the last two elections not because he was a weak MP, but because he could be relied on to ""fight hard and fight smart"" in a tough contest, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday in tribute.

In 2011, Mr Chong won Joo Chiat SMC with 51.02 per cent of the votes against Mr Yee Jenn Jong of the Workers' Party (WP).

In 2015, he wrested Punggol East back from the WP's Lee Li Lian with 51.76 per cent of the votes.

""Always by the skin of his teeth... because when there is a tough fight, and we need a strong candidate who will fight hard and fight smart, we send in Charles Chong,"" PM Lee said. ""And every time, Charles has delivered.""

PM Lee also paid tribute to Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, whose retirements he had announced earlier.

""Boon Wan has been in all my Cabinets from day one, when I became PM; we have fought and won many battles together,"" he said.

PM Lee described their comradeship as ""exceptional"", adding that ""the warmth and mutual regard we have for each other has grown over many years as we worked together, dealing with the spikiest of problems"".

As for Mr Goh, PM Lee said he owed Singapore's second prime minister ""a huge debt of gratitude, because he was the one who brought me into politics, and has guided and mentored me all these years, even after I succeeded him as PM"".

With the PAP fielding 27 new faces, about 20 MPs will be retiring this year, said PM Lee.

Each of them has served Singapore and the PAP loyally, he said, and has agreed to step down as they understand the need for self-renewal and had put the party and nation before self.

Among those likely to step down are former office holders, Mr Lim Swee Say, 65; Mr Lim Hng Kiang, 66; Professor Yaacob Ibrahim, 64; and Mr Lee Yi Shyan, 58.

Backbenchers who are expected to quit politics include Bukit Panjang MP Teo Ho Pin, 60; Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo, 66; Pioneer MP Cedric Foo, 59; Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan, 57; and Marine Parade GRC MP Fatimah Lateef, 54.

Speaking later, Mr Chong said his 32 years in politics have been most meaningful.

Here is a summary of key points in the 10 areas it covers:

FACING THE CRISIS OF A LIFETIME TOGETHER

Singapore has weathered many crises - separation from Malaysia in 1965; British withdrawal in the 1970s; recession in the 1980s; Asian financial crisis in the 1990s; 9/11; Sars and the global financial crisis in the 2000s.

Covid-19 is the most dangerous public health and economic crisis in over a generation.

The PAP will work with Singaporeans to bring everyone safely through the storm. It has clear plans for Singapore's future beyond the crisis, and will invest in people, rebuild the economy and strengthen society.

STAYING SAFE AND HEALTHY TOGETHER

Healthcare professionals and front-line agencies will be equipped to provide excellent healthcare for all, with $20 billion allocated to the Ministry of Health in recent Budgets.

Covid-19 testing and tracing capabilities, and investments in R&D for treatment and vaccines will be ramped up. There will be access to protective items, such as masks for all, new norms of safe interaction and improved public hygiene.

There will be more migrant worker housing with improved standards. Health clearance of migrant workers will be completed so they can return safely to work.

CREATING JOBS AND ACQUIRING SKILLS TOGETHER

Jobs are a top priority. There are wage subsidies to protect workers from the immediate impact of Covid-19, income relief for the self-employed, financial assistance for retrenched workers.

No effort will be spared to protect and create jobs for Singaporeans. They will be equipped to take advantage of growth sectors and new opportunities through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package.

Workers aged 40 to 60 will get extra SkillsFuture credits and subsidised reskilling programmes. Employers will get special incentives for hiring them.

Seniors, young job seekers, lower-wage workers and workers with disabilities will benefit from the Senior Employment Credit, re-employment grants and job redesigns, structured traineeships, enhanced Workfare support, extended Progressive Wage Model and Enabling Employment Credit.

TRANSFORMING AND GROWING THE ECONOMY TOGETHER

Businesses are receiving help to manage cash flow, costs and credit, with new laws on rental relief. Extra help is being given to hardest-hit sectors like aviation, hotels, tourism and retail.

Preparations for a post-Covid-19 economy include plans to speed up digital transformation, Transformation and Growth Packages, SMEs Go Digital grants and SkillsFuture Enterprise Credits.

There will be green lanes set up for safe travel with other countries, expanded trade networks to seek out new markets, and more diverse sources of food and essential supplies.

PROVIDING CARE AND SUPPORT TOGETHER

Families received help with expenses when the economy was shut down through cash payouts to parents and seniors, and utilities credits.

They will get continued help with costs of living through the Care and Support Package, enhanced housing grants, subsidies for transport, education and healthcare.

Related Story GE2020: Live coverage on Singapore General Election

There will be enhanced subsidies so pre-schools are as affordable as primary schools, with more places and higher quality.

There will also be more schools to cater to children with special education needs, and these will be more affordable.

There will also be more work and care options for such students beyond age 18.

Students from vulnerable backgrounds will get more support and guidance. Home-based learning will be made an integral part of education. Education reforms will be sped up, including more inter-disciplinary learning in higher education with lifelong learning in specialised areas.

Seniors will have more community-support networks, free entry to public gyms and pools, more financial security in retirement with the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme and enhanced Silver Support.

The polyclinic network will be expanded from 20 today to 32 by 2030.

To fund the healthcare needs of an ageing population, the goods and services tax (GST) will have to go up from 7 per cent to 9 per cent some time in the next term of government, but not before 2022.

To help Singaporeans cope with the GST hike, a $6 billion Assurance Package will pay for it for five years for most households and 10 years for lower-income households.

GST will continue to be absorbed by the Government on publicly subsidised healthcare and education, and there will be social assistance for those who need more help.

BUILDING A STRONG AND RESILIENT SOCIETY TOGETHER

The social compact will be strengthened through improved social safety nets, communities of care, digital inclusion and mental wellness.

There will be more support for social service agencies, through increased funding and matching of donations, as well as helping them transform their operations.

To boost financial resilience, almost $100 billion has been injected through four Budgets. The Government will continue to exercise financial prudence and replenish the reserves when it is able to do so to safeguard future generations.

LIVING SUSTAINABLY TOGETHER

Sustainability will be a way of life. Singapore will produce more clean energy by deploying more solar panels on building rooftops and reservoirs, reducing greenhouse emissions, and planting one million trees and new mangrove areas to preserve its carbon sinks.

There will be more nature in the city, with another 200ha of nature parks and 140ha of city parks and gardens over the next five years.

Singapore will face the storm of a century with unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude. The PAP will work with Singaporeans to seize new opportunities, reshape the future and build a sparkling city of tomorrow, emerging stronger from the crisis.

Coastal and inland flood protection against climate change and rising seas will be enhanced.

Local food production will be significantly scaled up, as will be long-term production capabilities for essential supplies.

BUILDING OUR CITY TOGETHER

Covid-19 will slow down, but not put an end to plans to develop Singapore - like the Tuas Megaport, Smart Nation and 5G network, Greater Southern Waterfront and Paya Lebar redevelopment, and rail networks.

CREATING A NEW FUTURE TOGETHER

Covid-19 has forced a global pause and reset. At this critical moment in human history, Singapore has a unique opportunity to reshape and redesign for the future.

The 4G leaders had earlier launched the Singapore Together movement for deeper partnership between the Government and Singaporeans to come up with plans for the country.

It will work with Singaporeans to chart a new direction for the country to emerge stronger as an economy, as a society and as a people.

OVERCOMING CRISIS TOGETHER

Singapore will face the storm of a century with unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude. The PAP will work with Singaporeans to seize new opportunities, reshape the future and build a sparkling city of tomorrow, emerging stronger from the crisis.

This, and more, will be done ""because we have the Singapore spirit and each other"".

In a year marking the nation's Golden Jubilee celebrations, it spoke of a city of hope, heart, and home. It laid out plans and dreams of a brighter future that Singaporeans could build together.

Fast forward five years, and Covid-19 has decimated jobs, cratered economies, and ruined lives worldwide.

Amid the pandemic and the country's worst recession since Independence in 1965, the PAP's GE2020 manifesto, released yesterday, is markedly more sombre and urgent in tone than the last.

It seeks to focus Singaporeans' minds on three things: their lives, their jobs, and their future.

The message is clear: This is not the time to play a game of chance with lives and livelihoods; the PAP has the capability and resources to tackle Singaporeans' most pressing needs.

""Without a herculean effort by us, we cannot be certain that what we have painstakingly built over decades will continue to stand, and not collapse in the storm,"" warned Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the PAP's secretary-general, in a live online broadcast yesterday.

He said that in a normal election, the party's manifesto would focus on its long-term plans for Singapore. But given the pandemic, this year's central focus is ""how we will work together to overcome this crisis of a generation"".

In the foreword to the manifesto, he wrote that jobs are the top priority. ""We have mounted a national effort to keep people in work, to help those out of work find replacement jobs, and to create new jobs and traineeships both in the public and private sectors.""

A cornerstone of this effort is the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, which seeks to provide 100,000 jobs, traineeship and skills training opportunities to those affected by Covid-19. The Jobs Support Scheme, which subsidises wages, has also enabled firms to keep their workers.

The Government has committed $93 billion in Covid-19 support measures over four Budgets, drawing up to $52 billion from past reserves.

Noting that the party has steered Singapore through every major crisis since independence, PM Lee said it has clear and bold strategies to rebuild Singapore's economy, strengthen its society and plan for the country's future.

On this count, the manifesto leaves no stone unturned.

It is sweeping yet specific, describing both current steps and future plans in public health, the economy, urban rejuvenation, social welfare and the environment.

As PM Lee promised, jobs are front and centre of the agenda. Separate sections are devoted to different groups of workers: those aged 40 to 60, seniors, young job seekers, lower-wage workers and those with disabilities.

The support is differentiated - those in their 40s to 60s, for example, would benefit more from SkillsFuture credits and mid-career pathway programmes, while younger Singaporeans will have structured traineeships and regional opportunities.

Similarly, social policies and measures are carved out to meet specific needs of various groups - from families and students, to seniors and those with special education needs.

Acknowledging another looming challenge - Singapore's ageing population - the manifesto reiterates what party leaders have said, that to fund growing healthcare needs, the goods and services tax (GST) has to go up to 9 per cent some time in the next term of government, but not before 2022.

To help Singaporeans cope with the hike, there will be a $6 billion Assurance Package and an enhanced GST permanent voucher scheme.

The manifesto also sets out the PAP's longer-term plans to build a dynamic, resilient and responsive economy, ""no matter what happens"".

These include accelerating digital transformation across all sectors, promoting new growth sectors such as cyber security and healthcare, and diversifying the country's sources of food and essential supplies.

While the manifesto is distinctly different in tone and substance from the previous one, there are a few perennial themes: expanding the social safety net, equalising opportunities through jobs and education, providing greater assurance in healthcare and retirement, and leaving no Singaporean behind.

When it comes to transforming Singapore's physical and digital landscape, developments that have made headlines recently, such as Smart Nation, the Rail Corridor, Greater Southern Waterfront and Paya Lebar developments, were already set in motion in the manifesto five years ago.

Then, the PAP spoke of a shared purpose and involving Singaporeans in shaping policies - an idea that has evolved in the last five years to become the Singapore Together movement, now fronted by the 4G leadership.

This continuity is useful, as a party manifesto serves two functions: Internally, it sharpens the messaging used by individual candidates; and externally, it communicates a party's values and value proposition to voters.

Related Story GE2020: Live coverage on Singapore General Election

Exactly how it will be used in election campaign material remains to be seen. But to the voters, the party's message is simple: We are consistent, we have a plan, and we can deliver.

As PM Lee said, this is not business or politics as usual, and Singaporeans want to know how the Government will solve their problems.

The aim is not just to survive the storm, ""but also to maintain the long-term direction for the country, and keep on building and improving Singapore"".

""Hardly ever before has government been so crucial to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. This is why leadership is key, whom you choose to form the next government - and the quality of that leadership - is absolutely critical.""

He added that ""what the PAP promises, the PAP will deliver"".

Whether that message resonates with voters, and whether they will deliver yet another victory to the ruling party at the polls, will be revealed come July 10.

Its line-up of new candidates includes entrepreneurs, business people and social workers, as well as former civil servants and Singapore Armed Forces leaders. More than half are from the private and people sectors. One of the 27 new faces, Mr Ivan Lim, withdrew yesterday.

The remaining candidates range in age from 30 to 55, with the bulk in their late 30s and early 40s.

Ten women candidates make their election debuts this year, double the number in the polls of 2015.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the party's secretary-general, said he was proud that collectively, the new candidates represent a wide range of life experiences and backgrounds.

""This is what makes the PAP the mainstream party in Singapore - a broad tent that occupies the middle ground, and represents the vast majority of Singaporeans,"" he said yesterday.

The PAP typically retires one-quarter of its MPs at each election. It has fielded an average of 24 new candidates over the last five general elections, so this year's line-up of 27 newcomers is higher than average.

PM Lee highlighted the achievements of a few of them yesterday, during a live broadcast on Facebook and YouTube to announce the party's manifesto.

Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui, 36, co-founder and managing director of Timbre Group, grew a restaurant business into an entertainment and food and beverage enterprise popular with younger Singaporeans.

Mr Mohamed Sharael Mohd Taha, 39, who began his career building race cars, went on to handle global projects for Rolls-Royce. He is now on secondment to Singapore Aero Engine Services as vice-president for strategy and project management.

Several, PM Lee noted, have founded social enterprises and non-profit organisations.

Ms Carrie Tan, 38, is founding executive director of Daughters of Tomorrow, a charity that helps underprivileged women with livelihoods. Ms Yeo Wan Ling, 44, is chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia, which connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers.

Ms Rachel Ong, 47, helped start youth development charity Trybe.

""Beyond ability and performance, the new candidates, just like the older ones, also have a strong commitment to serving people,"" PM Lee said.

For some, their road to success was harder and less direct, he added.

A few grew up in rental flats, including Mr Don Wee Boon Hong and Ms Mariam Jaafar, both 43.

Mr Wee chose polytechnic over junior college so he could start work early and help support his family. Ms Mariam's family made sacrifices for her education; she went on to graduate with degrees from Stanford and Harvard universities.

Two candidates came up through the Normal (Academic) stream in secondary school.

Ms Hany Soh Hui Bin, 33, worked as a paralegal and saved up for a law degree overseas. Today, she is a lawyer and sets up legal clinics as a community service.

MANY PATHS TO SUCCESS The PAP has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore: Regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves. Our candidates know this is true - they have made it happen in their own lives, they have lived the Singapore story. PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG

Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 42, earned a diploma from Temasek Polytechnic, a degree in physical education at age 31, then a doctorate from Nanyang Technological University. He now teaches at Republic Polytechnic.

""The PAP,"" PM Lee said, ""has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore: Regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves.

""Our candidates know this is true - they have made it happen in their own lives, they have lived the Singapore story.""

The new PAP candidates will soon face the cut and thrust of electoral politics and find themselves ""out of their comfort zones"" but ""they will get used to it, and some may even, in time, relish it"", he said.

""If elected, they will become your representatives in Parliament because they are like you, they understand you and your concerns, and they care for you,"" he said.

""You can trust them to speak up on your behalf, and to work closely with you to find good solutions for you and for Singapore.""",0.35373376623376623,0.125850900307422,Positive

They are Ms Poh Li San, Changi Airport Group's vice-president for Terminal 5 Planning, and Ms Mariam Jaafar, Singapore managing director and partner at the Boston Consulting Group.

The two new faces were featured in a video posted by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Saturday (June 27 ) that paid tribute to Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who is retiring from politics. Mr Khaw has anchored Sembawang GRC for 14 years.

In his post, Mr Ong said the Sembawang GRC slate was a five-man team when he joined in 2015.

""When the team was introduced publicly, Mr Khaw Boon Wan described it as the 'boy band'. Our lead singer has retired, and we have inducted two new lady candidates. We now look more like ABBA..+1,"" he said, referring to the Swedish pop group.

""We share the belief that Sembawang can be a very special place in Singapore, and must build upon the achievements of our predecessors,"" he wrote.

Ms Poh, 44, a former helicopter pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), is set to replace Mr Khaw in his Sembawang ward.

Ms Mariam, 43, is likely to replace Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Health Amrin Amin in his Woodlands ward.

Mr Amrin is tipped to move to the new Sengkang GRC, to complete the four-man PAP slate that includes labour chief Ng Chee Meng, Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min and lawyer Raymond Lye.

The new line-up for Sembawang GRC would then comprise Mr Ong, Ms Poh, Ms Mariam, lawyer Vikram Nair and ophthalmologist Lim Wee Kiak.

They are set to face off against the National Solidarity Party (NSP), which contested the constituency in the 2015 election. NSP secretary-general Spencer Ng said he will be leading the party's Sembawang team.

In 2015, the PAP team won 72.28 per cent of the vote against the NSP team formed by Mr Ng, Mr Eugene Yeo, Ms Kevryn Lim, Mr Yadzeth Haris and Mr Abdul Rasheed.

Ms Poh and Ms Mariam were officially introduced by the party last week. The former is vice-chairman of the Sembawang Citizens' Consultative Committee, while the latter is vice-chairman of the Woodlands Community Club management committee.

Ms Poh believes women should have greater access to more opportunities and leadership roles at the workplace, especially in the emerging sectors and in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) industries.

The PAP announced on Saturday (June 27) that Mr Lim had written to its secretary-general, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, earlier in the day to withdraw his candidacy.

Mr Lee has accepted his withdrawal.

The controversy surrounding Mr Lim, one of 27 new PAP candidates introduced last week, comes days before Nomination Day on Tuesday (June 30). It had caused concern among party activists that the issue would cloud the ruling party's campaign for the July 10 election.

In his letter to Mr Lee on Saturday, Mr Lim said further allegations emerged against him after he issued a clarification in response to initial allegations about his conduct at work and as a national service commander.

Mr Lim said the new allegations were ""baseless"".

""I recognise that the controversy over my candidacy has eclipsed the core issues of what this election should be about - Singapore's future and the difficult steps we have to take to recover from Covid-19,"" he wrote.

""The controversy has also caused intense pain and stress for my family. I cannot put my family through this,"" wrote the general manager (specialised vessels) at Keppel Offshore & Marine. He said he appreciated the support the party has given him in this period.

In his letter accepting Mr Lim's decision, Mr Lee said that the controversy about Mr Lim's candidature was unfortunate.

""Ideally, there would have been a fair and deliberate consideration of these allegations.

""Unfortunately, the nature of the campaign is such that we do not have time for a thorough investigation. The allegations spread like wildfire online, eclipsing the serious life and death issues we must grapple with,"" he wrote.

PM Lee said he respected Mr Lim's decision to withdraw, adding that he regretted the stress that Mr Lim and his family have had to bear during this period.

""I hope Singaporeans will give you and your family the peace and privacy to recover, and welcome your continued contribution to our society,"" added PM Lee.

Mr Lim, 42, who had been walking the ground in Jurong GRC and was expected to be fielded in the constituency, had earlier on Saturday responded to allegations of elitist behaviour and lack of humility in a statement through the party. He had said that he was ""determined to stay the course and to serve if I am elected"".

After Mr Lim was introduced as a candidate on Wednesday, several posts on social media accused him of elitist behaviour and of being arrogant as a national service commander, among other things. They were made by people who claimed to have known him during NS, in polytechnic, or at work.

However, several others who knew Mr Lim defended him in posts online. A video with three colleagues speaking about his character and qualities emerged on social media on Saturday.

Mr Lim responded to the allegations publicly for the first time in a statement issued by the party, saying: ""I accept that I can always do better and I am willing to learn. I will take this experience to heart and do my best to prove myself to voters and all Singaporeans.""

In his initial statement, Mr Lim said an allegation that he was involved in a bribery case concerning his company in Brazil was ""completely baseless and untrue"".

""I was not involved in any of the Brazilian projects,"" he said.

As for the stories about the army incidents, people can have different perspectives on the same incident, he added.

Mr Lim also said he set high standards for his military unit as a commanding officer, and that he did not ask soldiers to do something he was not prepared to do himself.

On criticisms from an ex-colleague, he said: ""The shipyard industry is a tough and exacting one and we have always required high standards of Keppel colleagues to ensure that they can return home safely to their families.""

As for another post on his not smiling to a neighbour in a lift, he said he did not recall a specific incident, adding: ""However, like many others who live in apartments, I know some neighbours better than others and interact with some more than others.""

Mr Lim's statement came shortly after Deputy Prime Minister and PAP first assistant secretary-general Heng Swee Keat said Saturday morning that Mr Lim should clarify the online criticisms.

Associate Professor Bilveer Singh of the National University of Singapore's (NUS) political science department said the PAP has prided itself on recruiting the best and brightest, but when such cases emerge, people will have deeper questions on the process.

He said of Mr Lim: ""If he withdraws, it will reflect badly on the PAP's judgment and selection process. But I think the backlash would be even greater, if he's kept.""

NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser said that while criticisms could be rationalised away, the court of public opinion may not be so easily convinced, if many already have a negative perception of him.

""The party leadership may have to weigh the odds of a fallout affecting the election outcome versus, say, a strong conviction that the candidate is a victim of a smear campaign and the party should therefore stand by its man, come what may.""

GE 2011 also saw a PAP candidate introduced who was eventually not fielded.

Unionist Steve Tan, then 37, dropped out on the eve of Nomination Day after allegations against him by former colleagues surfaced. He would have been fielded in Tampines GRC, but Mr Baey Yam Keng was moved there and orthopaedic surgeon Chia Shi-Lu, then 39, was fielded in Mr Baey's place in Tanjong Pagar GRC. Party leaders explained that Mr Chia was top of the party's reserve list.

Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, who was in charge of candidate recruitment, said then the PAP always catered to last-minute changes and had four reserves that year.

""It is not the first time that we have changed candidates at the last moment and it won't be the last,"" said Dr Ng then.

Prof Tan said the Ivan Lim incident could embolden others to use the same approach to call out candidates for public office in future.

""In the age of social media, any accusations could easily go viral, like a forest fire, and destroy the accused, unless the latter is able to do a quick comeback with a robust rebuttal, rather than let it simmer over several days,"" he added.",0.39348484848484844,0.11788518092315564,Positive

Below is a summary of key points in the 10 areas it covers:

1. Facing the Crisis of a Lifetime Together

Singapore has weathered many crises - Separation from Malaysia in 1965; British withdrawal in the 1970s; recession in the 1980s; Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s; Sept 11, Sars and Global Financial Crisis in the 2000s.

Covid-19 is the most dangerous public health and economic crisis in over a generation. The PAP will work with Singaporeans to bring everyone safely through the storm. It has clear plans for Singapore's future beyond the crisis, and will invest in people, rebuild the economy and strengthen society.

2. Staying Safe and Healthy Together

Healthcare professionals and front-line agencies equipped to provide excellent healthcare for all, with $20 billion allocated to Ministry of Health in recent budgets.

Ramped up Covid-19 testing and tracing capabilities, and investments in R&D for Covid-19 treatments and vaccines.

Access to protective items such as face masks for all, new norms of safe interaction and improved public hygiene.

More migrant worker housing with improved standards. Health clearance of migrant workers so they can return safely to work.

3. Creating Jobs and Acquiring Skills Together

Jobs are a top priority. Wage subsidies protect workers from the immediate impact of Covid-19, income relief for the self-employed, financial assistance for retrenched workers.

No effort spared to protect and create jobs for Singaporeans. They will be equipped to take advantage of growth sectors and new opportunities, through SGUnited Jobs and Skills package.

Workers aged 40 to 60 get extra SkillsFuture credits, subsidised reskilling programmes, special incentives for employers to hire them.

Seniors, young job seekers, lower-wage workers and workers with disabilities to benefit from Senior Employment Credit, re-employment grants and job redesign; structured traineeships; enhanced Workfare support and extended Progressive Wage Model; and Enabling Employment Credit, respectively.

4. Transforming and Growing the Economy Together

To stabilise them against the immediate effects of Covid-19, businesses get help with cash flow, costs and credit, new laws on rental relief, with extra help for the hardest hit sectors like aviation, hotels, tourism and retail.

Preparations for a post-Covid-19 economy include plans to speed up digital transformation, Transformation and Growth packages, SMEs Go Digital grants and SkillsFuture Enterprise Credits.

Green lanes set up for safe travel with other countries, expanded trade networks to seek out new markets, and more diverse sources of food and essential supplies.

5. Providing Care and Support Together

Families received help with expenses when the economy was shut down through cash payouts to parents and seniors, and utilities credits.

They will get continued help with cost of living, through the Care and Support Package, enhanced housing grants, subsidies for transport, education and healthcare.

Enhanced subsidies so pre-schools are as affordable as primary school, with more places and higher quality.

More schools to cater to children with special education needs; and more affordable. More work and care options for such students beyond age 18.

Students from vulnerable backgrounds to get more support and guidance. Home-based learning to be made an integral part of education. Education reforms to be sped up; more inter-disciplinary learning in higher education with life-long learning in specialised areas.

Seniors to have more community support networks, free entry to public gyms and pools, more financial security in retirement with Matched Retirement Savings Scheme and enhanced Silver Support.

Polyclinic network to be expanded from 20 today to 32 by 2030.

To fund the healthcare needs of an ageing population, the Goods and Services Tax must go up from 7 per cent to 9 per cent but not before 2022. To help Singaporeans cope with the GST hike, a $6 billion Assurance Package will pay for the GST increase for five years for most households and 10 years for lower-income households, with social assistance for those who need more help.

6. Building a Strong and Resilient Society Together

To strengthen the social compact, social safety nets will be improved, communities of care built with mental wellness as a key focus and greater digital inclusion.

More support for social service agencies, through increased funding and matching of donations, and help to transform their operations.

The Government will exercise financial prudence and replenish the reserves when it can, as a safeguard for future generations.

7. Living Sustainably Together

Sustainability will be a way of life, with more clean energy from solar panels on rooftops and reservoirs, reduced greenhouse emissions, planting of one million trees, new mangrove areas to preserve carbon sinks.

Another 200ha of nature parks, 140ha of city parks and gardens in the next five years.

Enhanced coastal and inland flood protection against climate change and rising seas.

Scaled-up local food production and long-term production capabilities for essential supplies.

8. Building Our City Together

Covid-19 will slow down but not put an end to plans such as Smart Nation, 5G network, Tuas Megaport, Greater Southern Waterfront, Paya Lebar redevelopment and doubling of rail networks.

9. Creating a New Future Together

Covid-19 has forced a global pause and reset. Singapore has a unique opportunity to redesign for the future.

The 4G leaders launched the Singapore Together movement for deeper partnership between the Government and Singaporeans, and will work with Singaporeans to chart a new direction for the country, to emerge stronger as an economy, society and people.

10. Overcoming Crisis Together

Singapore will face the storm of a century with unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude. The PAP will work with Singaporeans to seize new opportunities, reshape the future and build a sparkling city of tomorrow, emerging stronger from the crisis.

This, and more, will be done ""because we have the Singapore spirit and each other"".",0.358011433011433,0.15964486901986905,Positive

""These have been very helpful to residents and I hope that we will continue to look at what else needs to be done. When I ask them if these have been adequate, many of them have said yes, they can feel the flow of benefits,"" he added.

Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, was speaking to reporters after meeting hawkers and residents at Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre in West Coast GRC.

With him were two members of the People's Action Party (PAP) team, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har.

Mr Heng said his visit was meant to see if the Budget support measures have been working as intended, and if Singaporeans have further concerns.

He added that he was glad to hear many, including stallholders and workers, tell him the financial support has helped.

""A job is the most important thing for our people, because once they have that, it's not just one-time support, but it is a continuous stream of income that you can look forward to.

""So I'm very glad to see that many of our companies are responding to this, and our workers are keeping their jobs,"" said Mr Heng.

The Government's four Budgets this year will see around $93 billion spent to help companies, workers and households cope with the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, and a key measure is the Jobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers by footing up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of local workers' wages.

Mr Heng also said others told him they were glad to have the Solidarity Payment - $600 in cash for all adult Singaporeans, paid out in April - and Solidarity Utilities Credit scheme, along with service and conservancy charges rebates and income relief scheme for the self-employed.

Public agencies are also working hard to ensure the schemes reach their intended beneficiaries, he said, adding the hawkers he met are glad that they get rental waivers for five months, and a range of support measures.

""People are adjusting very well to this new situation. Many of them have told me how they are supporting one another, and this is the neighbourly spirit that we need to develop in our society,"" he added.

Mr Heng noted that some companies which have done well during this Covid-19 period have rewarded workers with bonuses, saying more companies should do so.

While most of Singapore's economy has resumed since the second phase of reopening began last Friday (June 19), Mr Heng urged caution as the pandemic is still raging around the world, and second waves have emerged elsewhere.

He added that the last three Budgets were done in ""double quick time"", compared to the usual budget preparation period, which takes months.

""I'm glad that the mechanism that we have in place allows us to respond quickly, and I want to see the measures reaching the ground effectively. So I'm glad to see that this is happening,"" he said, adding that he would be visiting other parts of Singapore too.

Mr Heng later visited Causeway Point in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, accompanied by members of the PAP team there, National Development Minister and Second Finance Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister of State for Manpower and National Development Zaqy Mohamad.

Meanwhile, asked about the challenge posed by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who is leading a team from the Progress Singapore Party to contest the five-member West Coast GRC, Mr Iswaran noted that other parties have contested the GRC in the past.

""Our message and stance have been consistent. We're focused on improving the lives and livelihoods of our residents. In other words, we want to take care of their needs, we want to enhance their well-being,"" he said.

Mr Iswaran added that the focus was on helping residents with immediate challenges posed by the Covid-19 situation, and also prepare for the long term.

""That is our focus, that is our message to our residents, and that is the basis on which we will campaign, and we will stand on our track record,"" he said.

The People's Action Party team won 78.57 per cent of the votes in the GRC in GE2015.

Mr Leon Khoo, 28, a stall-owner at Jurong West Hawker Centre selling handmade fries, said that while he has benefited from the five months worth of rental waivers, this measure would benefit hawkers in different places to different extents.

""For hawkers operating in hawker centres with higher human traffic, being allowed to take customers who are dining-in is more important as it forms a large proportion of their income,"" he said.",0.41235258993879687,0.18593073593073592,Positive

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the party's secretary-general, also unveiled the PAP's campaign slogan for the upcoming election ""Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future"".

Here is his speech in full:

Party comrades, brothers and sisters of the NTUC, my fellow Singaporeans, good morning.

We are going into elections in the midst of a global crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected many lives and livelihoods. After great effort, we have stabilised the situation in Singapore. Now we are resuming some activities and reopening our economy, cautiously, but our work is only just beginning.

The next government has a huge task ahead. It will have many important decisions to make, decisions that will affect our lives for years to come.

This is why I have called the general election now. It is to give Singapore a new government, a government with a full five-year term ahead of it and a fresh mandate from voters, a government which can focus on the urgent problems and deal decisively with them.

Today, the PAP is launching our manifesto for the general election. In a normal election, our manifesto would focus on all our long-term ideas to improve and transform Singapore - projects like the Tuas Megaport and Changi Terminal 5, development plans for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Jurong Lake District, more and better pre-schools, healthcare for the elderly, preparing for climate change.

All these plans are ambitious, but credible, because generation after generation, we have never stopped building on what we inherited in Singapore.

And also, because election after election, PAP governments have never failed to deliver on our promises to the people.

In normal elections, what is usually of much less interest to voters is the routine business of keeping Singapore going.

Singaporeans expect everything to continue running smoothly, and the PAP to continue to govern properly, before and after the election. They are confident the country will stay safe, our health services will continue to run, the economy will keep humming along, and jobs will always be available.

In other countries, this would be heroic, even reckless assumptions to make, but in Singapore, they are quite realistic, and have become the expectation and the norm.

But this time is different. This is not a normal election, and we are not in a normal situation.

We are in the middle of the most severe crisis in the world, that the world has faced for many decades. The immediate business of running Singapore is anything but routine.

Without a Herculean effort by us, we cannot be certain that what we have painstakingly built over decades will continue to stand, and not collapse in the storm.

Right now, keeping Singapore going, flying straight and level, safely through the turbulent weather is the most challenging and urgent priority for the Government.

Therefore, the central focus of this manifesto is how we will work together to overcome this crisis of a generation.

How we will keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe, and prevent Covid-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system and hospitals, how we will restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers to take on new jobs, how we will provide care and support to one another, so that together we can keep ourselves all of us safe amidst the uncertainties and dangers.

These issues are at the top of people's minds.

Singaporeans understand that this is not business as usual, or politics as usual. You want to know how the Government will work with you to solve your pressing worries.

This manifesto - Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future - answers your questions.

Beyond Covid-19 and jobs, Singaporeans will also want to know what longer-term future you can look forward to. Where will Singapore be, in five, 10, 20 years' time?

After the crisis passes, can Singapore resume our journey, onward and upward?

So this manifesto also sets out the PAP's longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, because our aim is not just to survive the storm, but also to maintain the long-term direction for the country, and keep on building and improving Singapore.

This is the manifesto of a responsible party and government. Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government, both to address your immediate needs, and also to work with you to secure your long-term future.

What the PAP promises, the PAP will deliver.

To put this manifesto into action, we need the full support of Singaporeans.

We also need a strong, steady and capable leadership team - a team with experience who've been through previous crises, who know what to do, what resources are at your disposal, and what pitfalls and traps to watch out for, a team with young faces and new ideas who can look at old problems from fresh perspectives, and come up with better solutions, and a dedicated and committed team who have a heart for people and a willingness to listen and who are determined to serve and to do their best for Singapore.

Hardly ever before has government been so crucial to protecting lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. This is why leadership is key.

Whom you choose to form the next government and the quality of that leadership, is absolutely critical.

But even the best leadership team is only as strong as the support it gets. So we must fight hard to convince Singaporeans that our PAP team is their team, and deserves their full support.

In this general election, we have made an exceptional effort to put together such a national team.

We are fielding 27 new candidates this time - more than a quarter of our total slate, and more than in any previous election. They have all been introduced over the last few days.

But actually, most of them were already familiar to many residents, because they have been working on the ground for some time. Quite a few have been grassroots leaders and party activists for several years now.

We also have a good mix: entrepreneurs, businessmen and women, lawyers, social workers, public servants and SAF officers. And we have more women this time, 10 new candidates are female - double the last round - including our first female SAF general.

Individually, each of the new candidates brings something different to the team. They are each proven in their respective fields and professions.

One of them co-founded a restaurant business, which eventually expanded into an entertainment and F&B company especially popular with younger Singaporeans.

Another is currently vice-president at an aerospace company. He came back to Singapore to lead a major project, after many years working in the UK and Europe.

But beyond ability and performance, the new candidates, just like the older ones, also have a strong commitment to serving people.

Several have founded social enterprises and non-profit organisations.

We also have former civil servants who led the Pioneer Generation Office, which has now become the Silver Generation Office, and the People's Association.

Several of the candidates have taken harder roads to success. Two grew up in rental flats, another two came up through the Normal (Academic) stream and went on to polytechnic. One later earned a PhD and is now back in the polytechnic, teaching, nurturing the next generation. The other one worked as a paralegal before saving enough to pursue a law degree overseas. And now she's a lawyer, and continues to give back, setting up legal clinics in the community.

In fact, altogether five of the new candidates are polytechnic diploma graduates.

Having succeeded, they are now helping others to succeed too.

The PAP has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore.

Regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves.

Our candidates know this is true - they've made it happen in their own lives. They have lived the Singapore story.

I am proud of our candidates individually. But what I am most proud of is that collectively, the new candidates represent a wide range of life experiences and backgrounds.

This is what makes the PAP the mainstream party in Singapore - a broad tent that occupies the middle ground, and represents the vast majority of Singaporeans.

Our new candidates come from all walks of life, and they are representative of the complexion of our society. And if elected, they will become your representatives in Parliament.

Because they are like you, they understand you and your concerns, and they care for you.

You can trust them to speak up on your behalf, and to work closely with you to find good solutions for you and for Singapore.

Because of time, I am not able to speak in detail about all the new candidates one by one but we have made a short video so that you can put faces to the names, and know who all of them are.

Comrades, Brothers and Sisters, I present to you the new PAP candidates for GE2020.

The new candidates will soon face the cut and thrust of electoral politics. It will be a big step, probably a little out of their comfort zones. But they will get used to it, and some may even in time, relish it.

But in any election, the candidates with the most challenging task are the ones standing in opposition wards, in Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC.

In 2015, our candidates fought extremely hard and performed very well. In Hougang, Lee Hong Chuang improved the PAP's vote share to 42 per cent.

In Aljunied, Victor Lye's GRC team did well enough to demand a recount of the votes.

Ever since then, the PAP teams have been hard at work on the ground in Hougang and in Aljunied. Now they are ready to contest again, this time wiser, more experienced, and having formed deeper bonds with the residents.

I hope Hougang and Aljunied voters will give them a chance to show what they can do.

To our Hougang and Aljunied team, and to all our candidates wherever you will be standing: we support you fully, and we wish you all the best!

In every election as we field new candidates, so we also have MPs who are retiring. This year, about 20 MPs are retiring.

One of them is the Deputy Speaker, Charles Chong. Of all the PAP MPs, Charles probably has experienced the narrowest winning margins in elections. In 2011 he won in Joo Chiat with 51 per cent of the vote. In 2015, he took back Punggol East with 52 per cent of the vote.

Always by the skin of his teeth, not because he is a weak MP, but because when there is a tough fight, and we need a strong candidate who will fight hard and fight smart, we send in Charles Chong. And every time, Charles has delivered.

Khaw Boon Wan is retiring too. I published my valedictory letter to him yesterday.

But what makes Boon Wan special is not something that can be easily put down in any letter. Boon Wan has been in all my Cabinets from day one when I became PM. We have fought and won many battles together.

The warmth and mutual regard we have for each other has grown over many years as we worked together, dealing with the spikiest of problems. Ours is an exceptional comradeship that one is sometimes privileged to experience when we commit ourselves to public service.

What I say of Boon Wan applies even more to ESM Goh Chok Tong. ESM Goh too is retiring at this election.

This marks a major transition point for Singapore politics. ESM has served Singapore with great distinction, 44 years as an MP for Marine Parade, and 14 years as Prime Minister.

He has touched the lives of so many Singaporeans, and given his all in service of our country and people.

Personally, I owe ESM Goh a huge debt of gratitude, because he was the one who brought me into politics, and has guided and mentored me all these years, even after I succeeded him as PM.

I do not have time to thank all the retiring MPs one by one today. Each one has served Singapore and the Party loyally. And I have no doubt that if they were to contest the coming GE, many of them would put up a strong showing.

But they have agreed to step down, because they understand the need for self-renewal, and have put the party and nation before themselves.

So after the general election, we will create the appropriate occasion to properly express our deep appreciation to them.

Comrades, today we launch our party manifesto. On Tuesday, the general election campaign starts.

We're going into battle, to win the mandate of the people in a crucial contest.

Make no mistake - this will be a tough election. Singaporeans have lost jobs, families have suffered, many are hurting from the pandemic. We cannot take any vote for granted.

The Singaporean voter is a tough judge. We must fight hard for every single vote, in every single constituency - PAP or opposition, SMC or GRC.

But after winning the people's mandate, we will have a much bigger fight: To protect our people's lives and livelihoods during this deep crisis.

And beyond that, to fight year after year, to keep Singapore successful and special for this and future generations.

These battles can only be won if the PAP has the full support of Singaporeans, and Singapore has the strongest and most committed leadership team to take our nation forward.

Let us give it our all. Convince Singaporeans to give the PAP their strong support, and to work with us to secure our lives, our jobs, and our future.

Thank you.",0.45575710189057644,0.19243540122777397,Positive

People's Action Party candidate Ivan Lim has announced he will not contest the general election. Read full story here

SINGAPORE - People's Action Party (PAP) candidate Ivan Lim on Saturday (June 27) addressed the criticisms levelled at him online, saying he is ""determined to stay the course and to serve"" if elected at the general election.

In a statement issued through the party, Mr Lim said: ""I accept that I can always do better and I am willing to learn. I will take this experience to heart and do my best to prove myself to voters and all Singaporeans.""

Criticisms from different quarters had surfaced online after the PAP introduced Mr Lim as one of its 27 new candidates to contest the July 10 general election on Wednesday, from people who claimed to have known him during national service or in polytechnic.

He was accused of elitist behaviour during a military exercise and of being arrogant, among other things.

In the statement, Mr Lim, 42, said it was important for him to state his position, as his family - in particular, his mother - was affected.

The general manager (specialised vessels) at Keppel Offshore & Marine said an allegation that he was involved in the company's bribery case in Brazil was ""completely baseless and untrue"", as he was not involved in any of Keppel's Brazilian projects.

As for the stories about the army incidents, people can have different perspectives of the same incident, he said.

""For example, it has been suggested in one of the posts that I was harsh for requiring the men to book-in at 2200 hours when the norm was 2359 hours,"" he noted.

""I should explain that on that occasion, the men had a move-out time early the next morning at 5am. It was important to ensure, and the rules required, that the men get enough rest. As such, I asked them to come back at 2200 hours and not 2359 hours,"" he added, noting that he came back earlier himself as well.

Mr Lim said he sets high standards for his military unit as a commanding officer, and believes in working together. He added that he did not ask the soldiers to do something he was not prepared to do himself.

On criticisms from a former colleague, he said: ""The shipyard industry is a tough and exacting one and we have always required high standards of Keppel colleagues to ensure that they can return home safely to their families. There are many colleagues who have been promoted and done well during my tenure as AGM and GM of Keppel.""

As for another post on how he did not smile at a neighbour in a lift, he said he did not recall a specific incident.

""However, like many others who live in apartments, I know some neighbours better than others and interact with some more than others,"" he added.

Mr Lim's statement came shortly after Deputy Prime Minister and PAP first assistant secretary-general Heng Swee Keat said on Saturday morning that he should clarify the online criticisms he has received.

Said Mr Lim: ""When I agreed to enter politics I expected that it would be tough. This test has come sooner than I expected.

Three incumbent Aljunied GRC MPs - party chief Pritam Singh, chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap - were joined by the two new members of the five-man slate during a walkabout at Block 538 Bedok North Street 3.

The two - Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) Leon Perera and former NCMP Gerald Giam - will replace former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwart Chen Show Mao, who will not be standing for election.

The party announced these changes during two online press briefings on Thursday and Friday, saying the moves are part of its leadership renewal process.

During the walkabout at a hawker centre and market, the WP members greeted residents and handed out WP fliers, had photographs taken with residents, and chatted with diners and stallholders.

Mr Singh was overheard telling a family who asked for a photograph that ""we must remember to keep 1m apart"".

Many residents greeted the WP members warmly - smiling and offering a thumbs-up as the politicians approached.

The WP team in Aljunied has been described by political observers as the party's ""A"" team.

Aljunied GRC is the only group representation constituency won by an opposition party.

On Saturday, Mr Singh thanked the media for adhering to the 1m safe distancing rules, saying: ""I know it's not easy, but the (safe distancing) ambassadors have a tough time, so let's try to help them out a bit.""

He declined to comment further, adding that the party will give more interviews in the days ahead.

Retiree Lin Siah Siong, 63, who has been living in the constituency for more than 30 years, said he will be casting his vote for the WP again.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said it was a pity Mr Low is stepping down.

He added: ""The candidates seemed sincere. They're not proud.""

Read full story here

SINGAPORE - The People's Action Party's first assistant secretary-general Heng Swee Keat says the party's new face Ivan Lim should clarify the online criticisms he has received since being introduced on Wednesday.

Mr Heng, who is Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, told reporters on Saturday (June 27): ""I have emphasised that integrity and character are very important in our candidates. And if there are any complaints, it should be properly clarified.

""So I would like to see Ivan himself coming out to clarify this comment, so that we can hear both sides of the story.""

Mr Heng was on a visit to Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre in West Coast GRC, along with Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har, both incumbent members of the PAP team in the constituency.

Mr Lim, 42, who is a general manager at Keppel Offshore & Marine, has recently been accused of elitist or arrogant behaviour by a number of people who claim to have known him at work or during national service.

However, others who know him have also come out in support of him online, and a video of several of his colleagues speaking up for him has been making the rounds on Saturday.

Mr Heng added that it was important to address the issue clearly, as all party candidates are expected to be able to address any concerns that may be raised about them.

""There are some of those who have put it on the Internet, they have also identified themselves - these are not anonymous points. And I would like to reach out to them to understand better what exactly had happened, so that we have a better understanding of the entire situation.""

He added: ""The key, as I mentioned, is whether the individual has the heart to serve all Singaporeans. And this is most important for us.""

And Singaporeans can trust them not only to represent their interests in Parliament, but also to work with citizens to find good solutions to Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday (June 27).

In a live broadcast to deliver the PAP election manifesto, PM Lee said the ruling party is fielding 27 new candidates this time, more than a quarter of its total slate and more than in any previous election.

There are also 10 women being brought onboard this time, double the number in the last election in 2015, he added.

While they were introduced to the public in the last few days, most of them are already familiar to residents, having worked on the ground for years as grassroots leaders and party activists in some cases, said PM Lee, who is the PAP secretary-general.

The new faces, PM Lee said, are a ""good mix: entrepreneurs, businessmen and women, lawyers, social workers, public servants and SAF officers"", including the Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) first female general, Ms Gan Siow Huang.

Each of them are proven in their respective fields and professions, he added.

Among those PM Lee highlighted were Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui, 36, the co-founder and managing director of Timbre Group, a restaurant business that grew to become an entertainment and food and beverage enterprise popular with younger Singaporeans.

He also touched on Mr Mohamed Sharael Mohd Taha, 39, who is vice-president for strategy and project management at Singapore Aero Engine Services.

Mr Sharael returned to Singapore to lead a major project, after spending many years working in Britain and Europe, PM Lee said.

""But beyond ability and performance, the new candidates, just like the older ones, also have a strong commitment to serving people,"" added PM Lee, noting that several of them have founded social enterprises and non-profit organisations.

These include Ms Carrie Tan, 38, founding executive director of charity Daughters of Tomorrow, and Ms Yeo Wan Ling, 44, chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia.

Several have also taken harder, less direct roads to success, said PM Lee.

These include two who grew up in rental flats - Mr Don Wee Boon Hong and Ms Mariam Jaafar, both 43 - and another two who went to the Normal (Academic) stream in school and went to polytechnic - Ms Hany Soh Hui Bin, 33, and Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 42.

PM Lee said: ""The PAP has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore: regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves.

""Our candidates know this is true - they have made it happen in their own lives, they have lived the Singapore story.""

The new PAP candidates will soon face the cut and thrust of electoral politics, and it will be a big step for them, ""probably a little out of their comfort zone"", he said. ""They will get used to it, and some may even relish it.""

PM Lee said he was proud that, collectively, the new candidates represent a wide range of life experiences and backgrounds, and that is what makes the PAP ""the mainstream party of Singapore - a broad tent that occupies the middle ground, and represents the vast majority of Singaporeans"".

Setting out what is at stake as he launched the People's Action Party's campaign manifesto, PM Lee stressed that the immediate business of running Singapore is anything but routine.

""Without a herculean effort by us, we cannot be certain that what we have painstakingly built over decades will continue to stand, and not collapse in the storm,"" he said.

""Right now, keeping Singapore going, flying straight and level through turbulent weather is the most challenging and urgent priority for the Government.""

PM Lee, who is the PAP's secretary-general, noted that in a normal election, the party's manifesto would focus on its long-term plans for Singapore.

But given the pandemic, he said the central focus of the PAP's manifesto is ""how we will work together to overcome this crisis of a generation"".

He highlighted three issues on the top of votersâ€™ minds: keeping Singaporeans and migrant workers safe from Covid-19 and keeping the disease from overwhelming the healthcare system; restarting and transforming the economy; and providing care and support to Singaporeans amid the uncertainty and dangers.

Said PM Lee: â€œSingaporeans understand that this is not business as usual, or politics as usual. You want to know how the Government will work with you to solve your pressing worries.â€

The partyâ€™s manifesto for this election â€“ â€œOur Lives, Our Jobs, Our Futureâ€ â€“ answers those questions, he said.

Beyond Covid-19 and jobs, Singaporeans also want to know whether the country can continue its upward march after the crisis subsides, and where Singapore will be in 20 yearsâ€™ time, he added.

â€œTherefore this manifesto also sets out the PAPâ€™s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, because our aim is not just to survive the storm but also to maintain the long-term direction for the country, and keep on building and improving Singapore,â€ he said.

He added that the manifesto was that of a responsible party and government.

â€œWhat the PAP promises, the PAP will deliver,â€ he said.

Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the manifesto launch was done over Facebook Live instead of at an event attended by party activists.

""Hardly ever before has government been so crucial to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. This is why leadership is key, whom you choose to form the next government - and the quality of that leadership - is absolutely critical,"" said PM Lee.

But he also said the team needed to work hard to convince Singaporeans that it deserved their support.

In 2015, the PAP's campaign slogan was ""With you, for you, for Singapore"".

With the manifesto launched, it is all systems go for the PAP, which completed introductions for its 27 new candidates on Friday.

The number of new candidates fielded this time to contest a total of 93 seats is higher than the partyâ€™s usual rate of one quarter renewal each GE.

The slate of new faces also comprises 11 women, more than double the five fielded in 2015.

PM Lee said the partyâ€™s new candidates have diverse backgrounds and can understand the concerns of all Singaporeans.

â€œOur new candidates come from all walks of life, and they are representative of the complexion of our society,â€ he said.

He also paid tribute to candidates contesting Workersâ€™ Party-held constituencies of Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC, and called on voters to support them in the coming polls.

The prime minister thanked retiring MPs including political veterans Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and seven-term backbencher Charles Chong.

The party has about 20 MPs retiring this time, he said, as he thanked them for their contributions.

â€œThey have agreed to step down, because they understand the need for self-renewal, and have put the party and nation before self. After the GE, we will create the appropriate occasion to properly express our deep appreciation to them.â€

In the days ahead, the party said it would announce its line-ups for various GRCs, and which MPs would be stepping aside to make way for new blood, before Nomination Day next Tuesday.

PM Lee said the general election will be a tough one, and called on party activists to fight hard for every single vote, in every constituency â€“ PAP or opposition, SMC or GRC.

Before the election in 2015, he had set his sights on having Education Minister Ong Ye Kung succeed him as anchor minister in the group representation constituency.

Speaking to reporters at Canberra MRT station yesterday after his retirement from politics was announced, Mr Khaw, 67, said he has known Mr Ong since his civil service days at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and described him as a ""very outstanding officer"".

""I was being selfish when I lobbied Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to get Mr Ong to come to Sembawang, so that I can hand over to him with confidence,"" he said. ""I'm quite sure that with Mr Ong, we made the right call.""

Yesterday, Mr Ong posted a tribute to his mentor on Facebook. He thanked Mr Khaw for including him in the Sembawang team and for the opportunity to lead negotiations on the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement signed in 2003 when he was a civil servant at MTI, describing it as a turning point in his career.

Yesterday, Mr Khaw teared up as he recounted Mr Ong's tribute. ""(It was) very kind of him to acknowledge the small role I played in his career. But that is the way we ought to behave as supervisors, or bosses, or managers - your job is to nurture the young.""

Mr Khaw tackled hot-button issues that emerged as flashpoints in past elections, from public transport to housing. On housing and transport, he said: ""Both were important, critical political problems. One was during GE2011, one was in GE2015. And if I could not deliver... I think the damage is to the party. So there was great pressure on our shoulders.""

His team, he said, ""dared not rest"" and continued to push on.

""Fortunately, with the support of many people... (we managed to) deliver,"" said Mr Khaw, who added he is glad rail reliability has not emerged as an issue in this election.

As for his approach to solving complex issues, he said teamwork is key. ""(If you) gather good people with the right ethos, you can make changes... this is, on a small scale, the story of Singapore.""

Chuckling as he related this anecdote, he said when he told his granddaughter, who is in Primary 2, about his retirement, her immediate thought was: ""Huh, there's nobody working in this family. So she says, oh, she has a solution - grandma must go and work. Then her next thought was, 'Grandpa, you must go and do marketing now. Do you know how to buy or not?'""

Reflecting on his more than 40 years in public service, he said: ""It has been very satisfying - so now it's time for me to rest.""",0.5560515873015873,0.20004464285714285,Positive

The ruling party will also progressively introduce its line-up of candidates for the GRCs and SMCs in the next few days, said the PAP's second assistant secretary-general Chan Chun Sing yesterday.

He made the announcement at a virtual press conference to introduce the last eight of 27 new faces that will contest the election.

Unveiled over three days, the newcomers are a varied lot: 15 come from the private sector, including such fields as law, banking and business, while the remaining 12 are drawn from the public service, the social and non-profit sector, and the military.

Asked if any of them are of ministerial calibre, Mr Chan said it is ""premature to do any such comparisons"".

""Even for the 2011 and 2015 batches, it is premature for us to try to claim credit or success,"" he added, referring to the new PAP faces in the last two elections.

In 2011, when Mr Chan was introduced along with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong and Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, they were called the ""Fantastic Five"" - touted to be the core of the fourth-generation leadership.

Yesterday, Mr Chan told reporters that while he was at the new Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) from 2012 to 2015, many had asked him if he thought he had done well enough as a minister or done enough for vulnerable families.

But such policy work, he said, is a long-term project.

""Many of the children whom we are helping will take 15 or 20 years to grow up. We will never really know whether we have done well until, perhaps, 15 or 20 years later.""

The same logic applies to other policies and issues, he added at the press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road.

""How we measure success is not whether they do well today or tomorrow only. It is whether they do well beyond the short term... And how do we collectively do well as a country.""

MEASURE OF SUCCESS How we measure success is not whether they do well today or tomorrow only. It is whether they do well beyond the short term... And how do we collectively do well as a country. PAP SECOND ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL CHAN CHUN SING, on policy work being a long-term project.

As electoral candidates, the mindset to adopt is, ""never be too anxious to claim success, but always be the first one to take responsibility to take Singapore forward"", he said.

Mr Chan was also asked about criticism that the PAP candidates have similar backgrounds, resulting in the possible danger of groupthink in the party.

He pointed out that the entire slate of 93 candidates, including incumbents, come from diverse backgrounds in varied sectors, including business, social service and the public service.

""We have covered the various sectors, but more importantly, beyond just where they come from... we should avoid pigeon-holing people just because of (their) profession.""

Every candidate, he said, has a unique personality, and Singaporeans will get a chance to know them better in the coming weeks.

On the lack of Indian candidates among the 27 newcomers, he said in the total slate of 93 candidates, there is an above-average representation of the Indian community.

There were nine Indian MPs from the PAP in the 13th Parliament, six of whom are office-holders, he noted.

This works out to 9.7 per cent of the total slate of PAP candidates, slightly higher than the ethnic composition in the population, as Indians made up 9 per cent of the resident population last year.

The need for all 93 candidates with different experiences to pull together as a team was reiterated by Mr Chan.

He said the PAP's leadership system is not one that involves pitting one batch of candidates against another.

""It is about different batches of people all coming together to serve with a common purpose.""

Continuity, consistency and coherence underlie its policies and they are not done by an individual or a single batch of people.

That's the kind of external situation Singapore, the little red cork bobbing on the channel connecting the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, is facing as it goes into an election in times such as it has never seen before.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong referred to it this week when he announced the July 10 parliamentary polls, pointing to a troubled landscape that includes tense United States-China ties, the looming American presidential election, the Sino-Indian border clashes and developments in the neighbourhood.

As he put it, ""we do not know what surprises lie in store for us within the next year"".

In retrospect, this perfect storm of geopolitical contest, rising nationalism and slowing economies - which is what PM Lee was referring to - had been on the bake for at least a decade. But it certainly accelerated with two events: the election of Mr Donald Trump as United States President in 2016 and, in October the following year when his Chinese counterpart, Mr Xi Jinping, declared at the 19th party congress that China was ready to take centre stage and set the model for other nations to follow.

This has now been crowned by the frightening pandemic that has claimed nearly half a million lives worldwide and cratered already-slowing Asian economies.

To understand how much of an insurgent Mr Trump has been since taking office, picture this: From the humble dung beetle in the African savannah to ancient mariners in Asian waters, the constellation of stars called the Milky Way has often been a guidepost for movement on Earth's surface.

But what if Polaris or North Star - which was what the US effectively was post-war with its bulging sinews and unending appetite for the world's goods - has gone missing from the constellation? Worse, has actively worked to disrupt it, for instance by threatening trade pacts, bringing the World Trade Organisation close to paralysis and, most recently, announcing a withdrawal from the United Nations World Health Organisation?

Meanwhile, a new Sun has entered the solar system in the shape of China, increasingly unabashed about its size and strength. It is like an Asian elephant that's discovered its true size vis-a-vis the stick-wielding mahout that gave it orders, and now demands the run of the forest.

This has set up the geopolitical clash of the century. Mr Kurt Campbell, the distinguished scholar and diplomat who retired as the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, recently noted that the centre of global politics has moved from Europe to Asia as the US swivels to confront the pre-eminent rising power.

The mix of ideology into the blend lends even more potency to the contest even as many of China's Asian neighbours and indeed others quite a distance away sense a new truth: Polaris is not necessarily the brightest in the constellation and may not even have the will to be that.

What's more, there could be a new beacon - for instance, Ecuador and Zimbabwe, two nations that have borrowed heavily from China, have also benefited from sharp falls in crime rates after buying into Chinese systems of mass surveillance.

The biggest regional uncertainty, of course, is China and where it is heading along a variety of dimensions. Events of the last 50 years suggest that China's internal struggles have often manifested externally - the 1962 war with India during the Great Leap Forward and the 1979 clash with Vietnam shortly after the launch of massive economic reforms being two examples.

Meanwhile, regional powers like Australia are going the other way. Worried about life as they know it being upended, they seem willing to sacrifice economic growth and the lure of the world's biggest market to stand up to Chinese pressure and alleged interference in their systems. This month, India and China had gruesome clashes in the high reaches of the Ladakh Himalayas as a resolute New Delhi locked horns with an assertive Beijing.

At the same time, in some regards, the US is beginning to behave like China - extracting a price to access its markets and when it suits it, fusing trade and strategy.

For all his attempts to draw New Delhi more tightly into Washington's strategic orbit, including offering to mediate in the dispute with China, Mr Trump this week unexpectedly announced a suspension of H1B skilled worker visas, provoking outrage in India's vital technology services industry which serves tech giants such as Amazon and Google. Indians typically make up 70 per cent of the 85,000 visas issued every year in that category.

Tensions are also spreading into hitherto uncharted areas, including cyberspace and outer space.

Several regional nations perceived to have partisan roles in the geopolitical contest have faced cyber attacks in recent years from state-backed actors, with Australia the most recent victim. Last month, Japan launched its new space defence unit, Space Operations Squadron, to protect its satellites from enemy attacks, adding to a list of nations, including China and India, that have similar outfits.

The biggest regional uncertainty, of course, is China and where it is heading along a variety of dimensions. Events of the last 50 years suggest that China's internal struggles have often manifested externally - the 1962 war with India during the Great Leap Forward and the 1979 clash with Vietnam shortly after the launch of massive economic reforms being two examples.

Stung now by the embarrassment of the pandemic being first reported from her soil, chafing at the security alignments that threaten her unimpeded pathways to the great oceans not to speak of access to food and energy, she has lashed out at a variety of nations, including Vietnam and to an extent, Malaysia.

In doing so, she has risked pushing countries who wanted to balance ties between the superpowers even closer to America. Indeed, as happened in 2016, when the Chinese coast guard intervened in the Natunas to free a poaching vessel captured within Indonesia's territorial waters, Chinese diplomacy is having to scramble time and again to soothe the ruffles caused by an assertive and edgy military.

Meanwhile, her giant economy is poised to record its first contraction in decades. Worryingly, unemployment is billowing. Debt failures in the offshore dollar market have already jumped nearly 150 per cent to US$4 billion (S$5.6 billion) this year - more than the total for the whole of last year. Just this Monday, Hilong Holding, an oil services firm, defaulted on a dollar bond after failing to get investor support for a debt swap. Any domestic instability in China will radiate across the region.

The geographical plates of the Malay peninsula and the physical wraparound by the Indonesian archipelago have protected Singapore from the worst maritime disasters, including the 2004 tsunami. That said, the Republic cannot be immune to the political and economic winds that blow in from those countries, particularly its closest neighbours.

Unable to export its way out of this crisis unlike in the time of the Asian financial flu, Malaysia's corporate sector is poised for upheaval in the second and third quarter as moratoriums on interest and debt payments lift. Close to a million young people will enter the workforce by the year end with shrunken prospects of finding well-paying work.

Indonesia could be in worse shape. More than 3.06 million Indonesians have either been laid off or furloughed as of May 27, according to Manpower Ministry data. The government expects that 5.5 million people in the country's workforce, dominated by those working in the informal sector, will lose their jobs this year. There are widespread complaints of government relief not reaching intended targets thanks to corruption. Neither are elite circles, including in the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), too happy with their President. Distracted by domestic compulsions, the big worry is that the Jokowi presidency will have little time to pay attention to Asean, which badly requires its largest nation and economy to show more leadership.

It is against this complex external backdrop that Singapore goes to the polls. Whoever wins will have to navigate through choppy international waters, with navigational guides that might no longer be applicable and perhaps even have to be rewritten, and even re-imagined. The tiny Republic, so reliant on global trade and being connected to the world, will find itself tossed and turned by the shifting geopolitical tides.

It is not a happy situation for any government leader, however experienced. China, India, Indonesia - the three big Asian nations and also major investment destinations and tourism markets for the Republic - are all in trouble one way or the other.

In all, the PAP is fielding 27 new candidates across the 93 seats it is contesting in the July 10 polls. The party has touted the diversity of its line-up of new faces, 18 of whom are from the private or non-profit sector.

Each and every one of them has a personality that deserves to be known better, he said. They should not be pigeonholed into any particular profession or character, just because they are from a certain background.

Yesterday, the party unveiled its final eight candidates to round off three days of candidate introductions. Today, the party will release its election manifesto, three days before Nomination Day on June 30.

The latest candidates include Ms Gan Siow Huang, 46, Singapore's first woman brigadier-general, who is expected to be part of the PAP's slate in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, as well as founder of a social enterprise Carrie Tan, 38.

Analysts say that a number of them - such as former brigadier-general Desmond Tan, 50; Ms Gan; and former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43 - are among those who appear marked for higher office.

The PAP has said that leadership transition is an important theme at the coming polls, with the party's 4G leadership expected to take over the reins in the next term of government.

One political veteran who is bowing out is Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who has made a name for himself as the Cabinet's ""Mr Fix-it"".

Announcing Mr Khaw's retirement, PM Lee paid tribute to him yesterday in a letter. Over a political career that has spanned nearly two decades, Mr Khaw has handled thorny issues including healthcare, housing and transport.

Mr Khaw himself wrote on Facebook: ""It's time to say farewell and disembark at the next station, confident that the next crew will take Singapore to newer heights.""",0.41503565878565873,0.11245559995559994,Positive

Mr Khaw, who is also Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure, entered politics in 2001 and is known for having tackled thorny issues across various ministries.

In a valedictory letter to the veteran politician yesterday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that Mr Khaw has helped Singapore overcome challenges spanning healthcare, housing and transport.

""In your quiet, unassuming way, you have made a huge and lasting contribution, and strengthened Singaporeans' faith that this Government can and will solve their problems and improve their lives,"" wrote PM Lee.

As Senior Minister of State for Health during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003, Mr Khaw was on the front line, checking on arrangements and encouraging hospital staff, he said.

He also instituted new processes that were applied when Covid-19 struck this year, said PM Lee.

In 2010, Mr Khaw had a heart bypass when he was Health Minister. He paid $8 out-of-pocket for the surgery, thanks to MediShield, Medisave and his private insurance, and used the incident to highlight the importance of health insurance and how government policies kept healthcare costs low for Singaporeans.

After the 2011 General Election, he helmed the National Development Ministry. Housing affordability was a hot-button issue that year. Mr Khaw ""ramped up the HDB building programme"", cutting waiting times and enabling young Singaporeans to own their first homes earlier through various policies, said PM Lee.

One of the biggest challenges Mr Khaw took on was to improve the MRT system, added PM Lee.

In 2015, when he was appointed Transport Minister, Singapore's MRT trains travelled an average of 133,000km between delays of more than five minutes - known as mean km between failure (MKBF).

Mr Khaw set a target of one million MKBF and many thought it was ""unrealistic"", but this target has since been surpassed, said PM Lee. In the first quarter of this year, the MRT system hit 1.4 million MKBF.

""This dramatic achievement is the product of a huge amount of hard work, your encouragement for the regulator and rail operators to work together as one team, your strengthening of rail engineering capabilities, and your emphasis on the crucial but often unnoticed work of continuous system maintenance and timely asset renewal,"" said PM Lee.

The Prime Minister called Mr Khaw, who has been in his Cabinet since he became PM in 2004, ""one of my most reliable lieutenants"" and thanked him for his personal advice and friendship"".

He pointed out that Mr Khaw had also made crucial contributions to the People's Action Party. After the party saw its vote share fall to 60.1 per cent in the 2011 election, Mr Khaw led introspective efforts to identify where it had fallen short and ""set the party on a fresh course"". It contributed to the party's decisive win in the next general election, he said.

""For the younger ministers, you have been a role model and a source of sage advice. They look to you to learn not only how to solve difficult problems, but also your seemingly effortless way of explaining nettlesome issues to Singaporeans.""

Mr Khaw's political juniors took to Facebook to pay tribute to him.

""He has been my teacher, my mentor, and helped shaped my career. He has been such a great influence, I would describe him as a Titan Minister,"" wrote Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, who will succeed Mr Khaw as the PAP team's anchor in Sembawang GRC.

In a Facebook post yesterday, Mr Khaw thanked his constituents, civil servants, colleagues in Parliament and the Cabinet. ""After 42 years of public service. It is a week of high emotion for me. Gratitude fills me to the brim!"" he wrote.

The former Colombo Plan scholar had been in public service since he graduated, and at one point served as principal private secretary to Mr Goh Chok Tong when he was prime minister. Mr Khaw also worked as permanent secretary at the Ministry of Trade and Industry before entering politics in 2001.

""Throughout this journey, my wife stands with me, as my strongest anchor. Our children and grandchildren remind me of the joys of family life, and the larger purpose of nation-building: It is to secure future generations of Singaporeans an even better life,"" he wrote.

Ms Poh Li San, Changi Airport Group's vice-president for Terminal 5 Planning, is expected to replace Mr Khaw on the PAP slate for Sembawang GRC. She was officially introduced by the party on Thursday.

PM Lee thanked Mr Khaw for his service and said he was glad he would continue to advise newer ministers after retirement. In a Facebook post, he said: ""On behalf of all Singaporeans, and especially residents in his Sembawang constituency, I thank Boon Wan for all that he has done, and wish him a happy, healthy and well-deserved rest.""",0.4758776223776223,0.08587995337995338,Positive

Ms Gan made history in 2015 when she became the first woman brigadier-general in Singapore.

She served in the military for more than 25 years, beginning as an air traffic controller and rising through the ranks to command Singapore's four airbases, the largest formation in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). She left the Singapore Armed Forces in March and is now deputy chief executive of the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute.

Ms Gan, who is married with three daughters aged eight, 13 and 17, is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, where she has been active on the ground.

Asked about the common criticism that former military personnel are not qualified to be politicians, she said her military experience has equipped her with leadership skills and she has been involved in areas such as long-term planning, policy work and manpower. She appealed to the public to not rely on stereotypes. ""I hope that people will give me a chance. Don't look at me as just another general - look at me for who I am.""

Ms Ong said she is energised by two things - seeing every young person succeed in life, and watching adults flourish in all that they do.

The founder and chief executive of training consultancy Rohei said that in order to help young people succeed, ""we must first learn to listen to, see, hear, understand and care for the needs of the youth"".

Ms Ong, who is single, has been active in West Coast GRC, where she serves as vice-chairman for the Telok Blangah Citizens' Consultative Committee. In 2001, she started charity Trybe, which runs the Singapore Boys' Hostel, the Community Rehabilitation Centre for first-time drug abusers and Trybe Aftercare, which provides youth with guidance and offers support for their families and communities.

She holds a Master of Business Administration from global business school Insead and Tsinghua University.

Mr Sharael began his career building race cars, and went on to handle global projects for Rolls-Royce. ""My mum was a nurse and my dad a taxi driver,"" he said. ""Never did I imagine I could do all these fantastic things with race cars, oil rigs, floating platforms and build a factory in Germany. Imagine that, a Malay boy building a factory in Germany. ""So I want to tell our youth to believe in themselves, to be inspired and to try it out.""

The father of three, who graduated with distinction in Master of Business Administration from Oxford, was based in Britain and oversaw Rolls-Royce projects across Britain, Germany, Canada and Singapore. He is now on secondment to Singapore Aero Engine Services as vice-president for strategy and project management. He was a volunteer in Bukit Batok East, but has been seen helping incumbent MP Zainal Sapari distribute hand sanitiser in his Pasir Ris East ward.

He hopes to help Singaporeans adapt to the new world of work, especially in the wake of the pandemic. Such digital transformation, he said, cannot take place at the expense of others. ""For the seniors, for the low-wage workers, and for the less able - we have to make sure they are part of this journey together.""

ALEX YEO SHENG CHYE, 41

Lawyer

Mr Yeo, a director at law firm Niru & Co, has chaired the party's Paya Lebar branch in opposition-held Aljunied GRC for more than three years. He admitted he was the ""newest and least experienced of the team"".

""Some of the team have been working very hard on the ground, trying to regain the trust of the Aljunied residents for the past nine years,"" he said. He declined to speculate on who would be fielded in Aljunied against the Workers' Party. He said he would like to help seniors and support less-privileged families in Paya Lebar.

He fell in love with his Hindu wife Priya, despite their being from different races and religions, ""because we share many similar Singaporean values and experiences"", he said. They met when they were foreign service officers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have two children aged five and seven.

""We are thankful that Singapore is a home where children can be whoever they wish, and yet have a singular identity - that of being Singaporeans,"" said Mr Yeo, who is a Catholic. ""I hope to play my small part in growing the inclusive society that we have worked so hard for over so many years.""

The daughter of a Malay teacher and a nurse grew up in a one-room rental flat in Toa Payoh.

She went on to study electrical engineering at Stanford University and attain a Master in Business Administration from Harvard Business School. That was thanks to her family who made sacrifices, and Singapore's education system, she said.

Now Singapore managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group, the vice-chairman of the Woodlands Community Club management committee is tipped to stand in Sembawang GRC. She is married with no children.

The upward mobility she enjoyed may be harder to attain today, and that is why she wants to help those who fall through the cracks. Areas in need of more attention include early childhood education, support for mothers, as well as gig economy workers, she said.

""Singapore must always be the place where someone from a humble background can grow up to believe she can do anything she wants to do, be anyone she wants to be.""

Ms Tan, the second daughter of a taxi driver-turned-contractor and a housewife, left the private sector in 2012 to set up social enterprise Daughters of Tomorrow, which helps underprivileged women in Singapore sustain their livelihoods.

Ms Tan, who is single and has been walking the ground in Nee Soon GRC, said she ""deliberated quite a bit"" when she was approached by the PAP to serve.

""In the past few years I've paid attention to government policies, and at times you may find that I seem to be quite critical of some of them,"" she said. But she has witnessed party members' sincerity and competence after getting to know them.

She added that ""certain people or groups in society... may feel that the Government may be a little bit high-handed at times"".

""I think that's very normal when people are required to perform under pressure and to solve problems. I feel that... I can bring my brand of care and empathy to the way politics is discussed.""

Ms Tan has a Master in Public Administration from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

Mr Huang, a father of two, is a former fighter pilot who spent 19 years in the Republic of Singapore Air Force. He graduated with distinction from the US Air Force Academy with a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was the first non-American top graduate in military performance. He was also the parade commander for the National Day Parade in 2018.

He is now the director for enterprise development at Temasek International, the management and investment arm of state investor Temasek Holdings.

Mr Huang described his 10 years as an active community volunteer in Taman Jurong as ""the best education"". He and other volunteers helped disadvantaged families and underprivileged youth by starting art, music and soccer programmes.

To address issues that led to children falling prey to drugs and violence, he helped to start Tasek Jurong, a not-for-profit organisation. Its early childhood intervention schemes provide targeted help. ""(We can) start as early in life as possible... to tip the scales of inequality,"" he said.

CHAN HUI YUH, 44

Marketing director

Ms Chan assisted the PAP in Aljunied GRC during the 2015 General Election, but did not stand as a candidate then because her two children were too young.

Now that they are in primary and secondary school, she decided it is a better time for her to enter politics. She began grassroots work in Siglap in 2000 and moved to Aljunied after 15 years. She has been Serangoon PAP branch chairman for six years.

Ms Chan, who is marketing director at waterproofing distributor Jingslink Marketing, would like to push for better access to childcare and eldercare.

""We have women who, because they have to look after their children, cannot go out to work, so we need to have more childcare facilities and negotiate affordable childcare so women can have peace of mind to go out and earn a living,"" she said.

It is also often women who end up leaving their jobs to become caregivers if parents fall ill, she added. They can be freed up to do the jobs they need to do with local ground-up initiatives to support them, and by making caregiving facilities affordable.

The ruling party's main concern, said Mr Chan, is the same today as it has been for many years - working closely with residents to continue solving their issues, taking care of them, and also collectively taking care of Singapore.

Mr Chan, who is the PAP's second assistant secretary-general, said: ""For Tanjong Pagar, we welcome other people to come and stand. It offers Tanjong Pagar residents a choice. We are not particularly focused on who is coming or going.""

He was responding to a question on the prospect of Mr Lee Hsien Yang, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's estranged brother, contesting in Tanjong Pagar GRC in the July 10 polls.

Mr Chan was speaking to reporters after wrapping up the last of the PAP candidate introductions in a virtual press conference at the party headquarters in New Upper Changi Road yesterday.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang has joined the opposition Progress Singapore Party (PSP), which announced his membership on Wednesday at a breakfast meeting in Tiong Bahru Food Centre, which is located in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

However, he was not among the PSP's slate of 24 candidates, the last of whom were announced yesterday. PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock said the line-up will not be firmed up until Nomination Day on Tuesday.

Tanjong Pagar GRC is a PAP stronghold and the bastion of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew - PM Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang's father. Mr Lee Kuan Yew held the Tanjong Pagar seat from 1955 - when it was a single seat - until his death in 2015, when it was a part of Tanjong Pagar GRC.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling have been embroiled in a long-running feud with PM Lee over the fate of their father's house in Oxley Road.

When asked if he would be standing for election, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said: ""When I am ready to disclose that, you will find out.""

Yesterday, Mr Chan said: ""From the PAP team's perspective, we are focused on serving our residents day in, day out, and we have been doing that for the last many years.

""I am sure Tanjong Pagar residents know us well, they know what we stand for, they know how we care for them.

""And I look forward to working closely with the residents to continue solving their issues, taking care of them, and also collectively taking care of Singapore.""",0.3013548180214847,0.15129268879268878,Positive

However, he also said that candidates should not be defined by a single moment in time or in their career, but judged instead by their growth throughout their lives.

A number of negative online comments have surfaced since Mr Lim was introduced as a PAP candidate on Wednesday, from people who claimed to have known him during national service or in polytechnic.

He was accused of elitist behaviour during a military exercise and being arrogant, among other criticisms.

Others who say they know him have also spoken up for him.

Responding to a question on Mr Lim at a virtual press conference, Mr Masagos said the general election will elicit responses about potential candidates, which is not surprising.

""But also, I think it is important for the candidates who may have been alleged to be something or other to also prove themselves,"" he said.

""(This is) also an opportunity for them, if they have done something in the past, to redeem themselves, because we have seen qualities in all our candidates that make them what we think are good leaders who will serve our people well.""

Mr Lim, 42, is a general manager (specialised vessels) at Keppel Offshore & Marine. He started working at Keppel Shipyard at the age of 16, after his O levels.

He was awarded a scholarship by Keppel to study for a diploma at Singapore Polytechnic, after which he pursued a degree in marine engineering at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

Married with four children, he is expected to be fielded in Jurong GRC.

The Straits Times has contacted Mr Lim for comment.

Each new batch of leaders works with its predecessors so that the PAP Government can plan long term and ensure continuity in its policies, said Mr Chan, who is also the party's second assistant secretary-general.

""There is a certain consistency and a certain coherence, and it is not done by just any single batch of people or any individual. That's how we perform as a team for the good of Singapore,"" he said.

In all, the PAP is fielding 27 new candidates across the 93 seats it is contesting in the July 10 polls. The party has touted the diversity of its line-up of new faces, 18 of whom are from the private or non-profit sector.

Each and every one of them has a personality that deserves to be known better, he said. They should not be pigeonholed into any particular profession or character, just because they are from a certain background.

On Friday (June 26), the party unveiled its final eight candidates to round off three days of candidate introductions. On Saturday, the party will release its election manifesto, three days before Nomination Day next Tuesday.

The latest candidates include Ms Gan Siow Huang, 46, Singapore's first woman brigadier-general, who is expected to be part of the PAP's slate in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, as well as charity founder Carrie Tan, 38.

Analysts say that a number of them - such as former brigadier-general Desmond Tan, 50, Ms Gan, and former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43 - are among those who appear marked for higher office.

The PAP has said that leadership transition is an important theme at the coming polls, with the party's 4G leadership expected to take over the reins in the next term of government.

Said Mr Chan: ""We hope that this election will give Singaporeans a chance to look at the different parties, the different candidates, (and see) which parties can come forward to serve the people with good, workable ideas that can take Singapore forward.""

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will make it known which MPs would be stepping down to make way for new blood, said Mr Chan, who was speaking via video link from the PAP headquarters in Bedok.

One political veteran who is bowing out is Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who has made a name for himself as the Cabinet's ""Mr Fix-it"".

Announcing Mr Khaw's retirement, PM Lee paid tribute to him on Friday in a letter. Over a political career that has spanned nearly two decades, Mr Khaw had handled thorny issues including healthcare, housing and transport.

The Transport Minister is retiring from politics after 19 years, in an election season that has also seen two other veterans announce their departure - former opposition leader Low Thia Khiang of the Workers' Party and former prime minister Goh Chok Tong.

It was Mr Goh who persuaded Mr Khaw, his former principal private secretary, to stand as a People's Action Party candidate back in 2001.

Since then, Mr Khaw, 67, has earned a reputation as Mr Fix-it due to his knack for solving hot-button issues that others struggled to come to grips with.

In 2011, he not only took on but volunteered for the high-stress job of fixing the nation's housing woes, one of a handful of issues which cost the PAP to lose vote share in that year's polls.

He moved to head the Ministry of National Development in May 2011 with ""trepidation"", he wrote in a Facebook post, as it was then ""red hot with widespread unhappiness"".

He did so just one year after undergoing open-heart surgery, yet he pledged to ""work triply hard to shorten the learning curve"".

His resolve bore fruit. During his four years as National Development Minister, he cracked the twin problems of housing availability and affordability by ramping up the HDB's building programme, boldly delinking the prices of new flats from those on the resale market, and raising subsidies and income ceilings so more young people could buy their first homes.

By the time he handed over the portfolio to Mr Lawrence Wong in 2015, the housing shortage was largely solved.

Fixing trains

That year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong handed Mr Khaw another tough assignment - to fix transport at a time when train breakdowns were a major problem and the reliability of the entire rail network was in doubt.

Once again, Mr Khaw stepped up and got the job done.

Related Story In Pictures: Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan to retire from politics

He put in place ""early closure, late opening"" of the rail network so as to give rail engineers and technicians more time to safely complete repairs, maintenance and renewal work on MRT lines.

To raise morale on the ground, he visited depots, interchanges and tunnels to understand workers' challenges and celebrate milestones. The engineers, technicians and maintenance crews who toiled day and night were the ministry's ""most precious"" assets, more so than the billion-dollar rail networks, he wrote in his Moving News blog in 2015.

By setting high and clear targets for senior management at SMRT and SBS Transit, he also fostered a more unified approach between regulator and operators in undertaking tasks.

Sars combat chief

Besides housing and transport, Mr Khaw's other major contributions were in health.

While a civil servant in the Health Ministry in the late 70s and early 80s, he helped formulate Medisave, which every Singaporean now uses if he needs to pay for hospitalisation. He also spent seven years restructuring government hospitals, during which time he was consecutively chief executive officer of the National University, KK and Singapore General hospitals.

In 2003, he was tapped to help Singapore battle Sars and served as Sars combat chief. In 2004, he was appointed Health Minister and learning from the painful lessons of Sars, he instituted new processes and extensive preparations to ready Singapore for the next novel disease outbreak. These have ""served us well when Covid-19 came upon us"", Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote in his thank-you letter to Mr Khaw.

Over the next seven years, Mr Khaw proceeded to reform Medisave and health insurance plan MediShield, launch long-term care insurance scheme ElderShield - all changes to ensure that healthcare costs remained affordable.

To expand Singapore's healthcare capacity, he laid the groundwork for three new hospitals - Khoo Teck Puat, Sengkang General and Ng Teng Fong.

The ruling party will also progressively introduce its line-up of candidates for the GRCs and SMCs in the next few days, said PAP second assistant secretary-general Chan Chun Sing on Friday (June 26).

He made the announcement at a virtual press conference to introduce the last eight of 27 new faces who will contest the election.

Unveiled over three days, the newcomers are a varied lot: 15 are from the private sector, including such fields as law, banking and business, while the remaining dozen are from the public service, the social and non-profit sector, and the military.

Asked if any of the new faces are of ministerial calibre, Mr Chan said it is ""premature to do any such comparisons"".

""Even for the 2011 and 2015 batches, I think it is premature for us to try to claim credit or success,"" he added, referring to the new PAP faces in the last two general elections.

In 2011, when Mr Chan was introduced along with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong and Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, they were called the ""Fantastic Five"" - touted to be the core of the fourth-generation leadership.

On Friday, Mr Chan told reporters that after he took the helm at the newly formed Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) in 2012, many had asked him if he thought he had done well enough as a minister or done enough for vulnerable families.

But such policy work, he said, are long-term projects.

""Many of the children whom we are helping will take 15 or 20 years to grow up. We will never really know whether we have done well until, perhaps, 15 or 20 years later... But we all hope that we have done the right thing, and (that we have given) these underprivileged children the best chance to succeed in life.""

The same logic applies to other policies and issues, he added at the press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road.

""How we measure success is not whether they do well today or tomorrow only. It is whether they do well beyond the short term, in the medium and long term. And how do we collectively do well as a country. That is the real mark of success.""

As electoral candidates, the mindset to adopt is, ""Never be too anxious to claim success, but always be the first one to take responsibility to take Singapore forward,"" he said.

""And if we can have that kind of mindset, we will have the right set of people.""

Mr Chan was also asked about criticisms that the PAP candidates have similar backgrounds, and the possible danger of groupthink in the party,

He pointed out that the entire slate of 93 candidates, including incumbents, come from diverse backgrounds, including business, social and the public service sectors.

""We have covered the various sectors, but more importantly, beyond just where they come from... we should avoid pigeon-holing people just because of (their) profession,"" he added.

Every candidate, he said, has a unique personality, and Singaporeans will get a chance to know them better in the coming weeks and months - ""their personalities, their working styles, the causes that they believe in"".

The PAP, he said, has tried hard to bring in people from all walks of life.

""(The candidates) represent Singapore, they represent Singaporeans, they understand, they feel the fears, concerns and aspirations of our people.

""We have chosen them from diverse backgrounds but, as I've said, they are united only by one thing - the commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, the commitment to take Singapore forward and to distinguish ourselves among all other nations.""

On the lack of Indian candidates among the 27 newcomers, Mr Chan replied that in the total slate of 93 PAP candidates - including newcomers and old-timers - there is an above-average representation of the Indian community.

Currently, there are nine Indian MPs in Parliament, six of whom are office holders, he noted.

This works out to 9.7 per cent of the total slate of PAP candidates, slightly higher than the ethnic composition of the population, as Indians make up 9 per cent of the resident population in 2019.

""So the quality of our Indian candidates is very high, both numerically and proportionally,"" he added.

With the number of seats increasing from 89 to 93 seats in the upcoming election, more PAP branches will also need to be set up.

These branches will be set up after the election, he said.

""At this point in time, we are focused on taking care of the (Covid-19) situation, both at the national level and the local level, to help manage the health situation and also overcome the economic challenges, particularly the emphasis to help those who have been displaced to get jobs,"" he said.

The branches will be progressively set up according to the new boundaries drawn up by the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee, he added.

The need for all 93 candidates with different experiences to work as a team was reiterated by Mr Chan.

He said the PAP's leadership system is not one that involves pitting one batch of candidates against another.

""It is about different batches of people all coming together to serve with a common purpose. There is continuity in the way we do our policies - we reach out to the residents and we make long-term plans for the country.

""There is a certain consistency, and a certain coherence and it is not done by just any single batch of people or any individual.

""So that is how we will perform as a team for the good of Singapore"".",0.4147712554112555,0.1107300432900433,Positive

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong thanked Mr Khaw, who is also Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure, for his lifetime of public service to Singapore in a valedictory letter released to the media on Friday (June 26).

Here is his letter in full:

26 June 2020

Mr Khaw Boon Wan

Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport

Dear Boon Wan,

As you retire from politics, I write to thank you for your lifetime of public service to Singapore.

You entered politics in 2001, after a distinguished public service career. By chance, the years of both your joining and leaving politics have been marked by global crises - then the aftermath of September 11, and now the Covid-19 pandemic. They bookend a remarkable political career, during which you have taken on the most challenging jobs in the Cabinet. In your quiet, unassuming way, you have made a huge and lasting contribution, and strengthened Singaporeans' faith that this Government can and will solve their problems and improve their lives.

One of your first appointments after being elected was to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Healthcare was not new to you, having run several hospitals as a civil servant. When the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak happened, you were Senior Minister of State. You were on the front line, going into the hospitals to check on the arrangements and encourage the medical staff. Subsequently, you took over as Minister for Health from Mr Lim Hng Kiang. Learning the painful lessons of Sars, you instituted new processes and extensive preparations, to get us ready for the next novel disease outbreak. These served us well when Covid-19 came upon us.

At MOH, you also reformed MediShield and MediSave, and introduced ElderShield. These fundamental reforms reassured many Singaporeans that healthcare costs would remain affordable. You expanded our healthcare capacity significantly, laying the groundwork for Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, and establishing the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School as Singapore's second medical school.

After the 2011 General Election, you took on the National Development portfolio. Your immediate task was to assuage public concerns about HDB waiting times and affordability. You ramped up the HDB building programme, reduced Built-to-Order (BTO) waiting times and introduced policies to enable newlyweds to own their first flat earlier and live near their parents. These measures gave young Singaporeans the confidence that an affordable home would always be within their reach.

At the same time, you advanced plans to remake Singapore into a liveable and sustainable city. In the URA Master Plan 2014, you set out our vision to expand the city centre to the Greater Southern Waterfront, and to extend our Park Connector Network throughout Singapore and make us a City in a Garden. Future generations will build on these lasting legacies.

Having helmed Health and National Development, no one would have begrudged you lighter responsibilities in the subsequent term. Yet after the 2015 General Election, you volunteered to take on the politically spiky transport portfolio, and later to serve as Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure. Our immediate priority was to improve the reliability of our MRT system. To achieve this, you set a target of one million mean kilometres between failures (MKBF), which at the time many thought unrealistic. But in the first quarter of this year, our MRT system not only achieved your target but surpassed it, hitting 1.4 million MKBF. This dramatic achievement is the product of a huge amount of hard work, your encouragement for the regulator and rail operators to work together as one team, your strengthening of rail engineering capabilities, and your emphasis on the crucial but often unnoticed work of continuous system maintenance and timely asset renewal.

Externally, you strengthened Singapore's air hub and sea hub status. On your watch, Singapore was successfully re-elected to the International Civil Aviation Organisation Council and International Maritime Organisation Council. You pushed for the construction of Changi Runway 3, Changi Airport Terminal 5 and the Tuas Megaport. These projects have been affected by the current uncertainties, and the schedules have to be adjusted and plans reviewed, especially for Terminal 5. But we are determined that Singapore should remain an air and sea hub, and these long term investments will help consolidate Singapore's position in the post-Covid-19 world.

With Malaysia, we concluded complicated negotiations on the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail. Due to changes of government in Malaysia and the pandemic, both projects have been delayed, but discussions continue with our Malaysian counterparts to reach a win-win outcome. With Indonesia too, airspace remains a complex and sensitive bilateral issue under discussion. In both cases, your personal rapport with foreign counterparts has proved invaluable.

Besides your Ministerial duties, you also made significant contributions to the People's Action Party. After the disappointing results of the 2011 General Election, you led the post-mortem to identify where the Party had fallen short. You presented your conclusions and recommendations at the 2011 Party Conference, where they were actively debated. That was a watershed moment for the PAP. The honest introspection and self-critique set the Party on a fresh course. Following that Conference, you became Party Chairman taking over from Lim Boon Heng, and played your part to drive change from within. This contributed much to our decisive win in the 2015 General Election.

As an MP, you are well known for being dedicated and responsive to residents. You were active in bringing the community together, and infusing the kampung spirit in your residents. You took special pride in keeping Sembawang clean and green, and residents often encountered you when you took walks in Sembawang Park to relax. Sayang Sembawang, your community tagline, encapsulated your efforts to make Sembawang an endearing home.

You were in my Cabinet since day one, and have been one of my most reliable lieutenants. Beyond your own portfolios, your comments on matters put before Cabinet always went to the heart of the matter, and focussed our minds on the key considerations and trade-offs. Beyond your ministerial and political contributions, I have deeply appreciated our personal friendship, and greatly benefitted from your advice. You were the one who in 2012 suggested that I venture into social media, which I had until then considered a foreign land, to engage an audience not likely to follow my speeches and statements in detail. Having now done it for eight years, I have found it a fascinating and worthwhile journey.

For the younger Ministers, you have been a role model and a source of sage advice. They look to you to learn not only how to solve difficult problems, but also your seemingly effortless way of explaining nettlesome issues to Singaporeans. I am thus happy that even after you retire, you have agreed to continue to be available to advise your successors on the issues that you have handled as a Minister, and to share with them your experience and wisdom.

On behalf of all Singaporeans, and especially your residents in Sembawang, I thank you for all that you have done for Singapore, and wish you a happy, healthy and well-deserved retirement.

Yours sincerely,

Lee Hsien Loong",0.4508520183520185,0.11126086876086874,Positive

He added that candidates should not be defined by a single moment in time or in their career, but judged instead by their growth throughout their life.

A number of negative online comments have surfaced since Mr Lim, 42, was introduced as a PAP candidate on Wednesday, from people who claimed to have known him during national service or in polytechnic.

He was accused of elitist behaviour during a military exercise and being arrogant, among other criticisms.

Others who say they know him have also spoken up for him.

Responding to a question on Mr Lim at a virtual press conference, Mr Masagos said the general election will ""elicit responses which are not surprising"" about potential candidates.

""But also I think it is important for the candidates who may have been alleged to be something or other to also prove themselves,"" he said.

""(This is) also an opportunity for them, if they have done something in the past, to redeem themselves, because we have seen qualities in all our candidates that make them what we think are good leaders who will serve our people well,"" said Mr Masagos.

Mr Lim, 42, is a general manager overseeing specialised vessels at Keppel Offshore & Marine.

He started working at Keppel Shipyard at the age of 16 after his O levels.

He was awarded a scholarship by Keppel to study for a diploma at Singapore Polytechnic, after which he pursued his degree in marine engineering at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

Married with four children, he is expected to be fielded in Jurong GRC.

The line-up this time included Ms Gan Siow Huang, 46, the first woman brigadier-general in Singapore, as well as three other candidates from the non-profit and private sectors: Ms Rachel Ong Sin Yen, 47; lawyer Alex Yeo Sheng Chye, 41; and Mr Sharael Taha, 39, a vice-president at Singapore Aero Engine, now on secondment from Rolls Royce.

They were introduced by PAP vice-chairman Masagos Zulkifli at a virtual press conference streamed from the People's Action Party headquarters in New Upper Changi Road.

PAP second assistant secretary-general Chan Chun Sing introduced another four candidates in a separate session: Boston Consulting Group managing director Mariam Jaafar, 43; Temasek enterprise development director Mr Shawn Huang, 37; marketing director Chan Hui Yuh, 44; and charity founder Carrie Tan, 38.

With this round of introductions, the PAP has unveiled 27 new faces in all for the upcoming polls. Previously, it said it would present 26 new candidates.

Mr Chan said Ms Chan Hui Yuh is not exactly new, as she assisted the PAP in Aljunied GRC at the 2015 general election, but they had decided to include her, as she is running for election for the first time.

The new candidates are:

Ms Gan Siow Huang, 46

Former air force brigadier-general

Ms Gan, 46, who is married with three children, is now deputy chief executive officer of the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute.

She is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, where she has been active on the ground.

Ms Gan made history in 2015 when she became the first woman brigadier-general in Singapore. She resigned from her role as Chief of Staff - Air Staff in March.

She said she had served in the military for more than 25 years - ""one of the best choices and fulfilling choices that I made for myself"".

The armed forces, she said, is a place ""where men and women of different races, religions backgrounds, all come together, serving common goal to protect Singapore"". This desire to serve Singapore remained with her even after leaving the military.

The mission of the labour movement resonates with her, she said.

""I know the importance of bread and butter (issues) and the importance of having a job, to be able to protect one's lives, and their families"".

Asked about criticism that former military personnel are not qualified to be politicians, Ms Gan said she takes pride in her military experience, which has equipped her with leadership skills.

She added that in her military career, other than operations, she had been involved in long-term planning, capability development and policy work, manpower, intelligence, among others.

""I would say that I have gathered... several building blocks that I think are critical to any good organising entity and I would say the leadership experiences that I gained and also the lessons I learnt in taking care of people will help me to be a good politician.""

She appealed to the public to not rely on stereotypes. ""I hope that people will give me a chance - don't look at me as just another general - look at me for who I am.""

Ms Rachel Ong Sin Yen, 47

Rohei chief executive

Ms Ong, 47, who is single, has been active in West Coast GRC, where she serves as vice-chairman for the Telok Blangah Citizens' Consultative Committee.

She said that she is energised by two things - seeing every young person succeed in life, and adults flourish in all that they do.

In order to help young people succeed, she said ""we first must learn to listen to, to see, to hear, to understand and to care for the needs of the youth"".

She started Trybe, a charity with Institute of Public Character (IPC) status, in 2001.

Trybe runs the Singapore Boys Hostel, Community Rehabilitation Centre for first-time drug abusers as well as Trybe Aftercare. It provides young people with guidance and offers support for their families and communities.

Ms Ong also holds a Master's in Business Administration from global business school Insead and Tsinghua University.

He graduated with a Distinction in Master's of Business Administration from the University of Oxford.

Mr Sharael hopes to help Singaporeans adapt to the new world of work, noting that the Covid-19 pandemic has posed challenges for workers.

""I would like to work with you to develop new skills and share my experience from high-tech industries, so that we can create... good jobs for the future of our families,"" he said.

He stressed that such digital transformation cannot take place at the expense of others.

""For the seniors, for the low-wage workers, and for the less able - we have to make sure that they are part of this journey together. We will ensure that we leave no one behind.""

Mr Yeo, a lawyer, has chaired the party's Paya Lebar branch in opposition-held Aljunied GRC for more than three years.

He said he would like to help seniors and support less privileged families in Paya Lebar.

Another item on his to-do list is to address the challenges faced by parents of young children, who have to juggle between their work and family needs.

He said he fell in love with his wife, Priya, who is Hindu and South Asian, despite them being different culturally and having different religions ""because we share many similar Singaporean values and experiences"".

""We are thankful that Singapore is the home where children can be whoever they wish, and yet have a singular identity - that of being Singaporeans,"" said Mr Yeo, who is Catholic. He sees such values demonstrated in the community as well throughout his volunteering experiences.

""I hope to play my small part in contributing to continue to grow our inclusive society that we have worked so hard over so many years.""

Asked about the PAP team's chances at the upcoming election in wresting Aljunied GRC back from the Workers' Party, Mr Yeo said that while he is unable to speculate on the outcome, the team has been working hard on the ground for more than nine years to serve residents in the area.

Ms Mariam Jaafar, 43

Singapore managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group

Ms Mariam grew up in a one-room rental flat in Toa Payoh.

The daughter of a Malay teacher and a nurse, she said that while she had a happy childhood, there were moments when she knew things were not easy.

She would wake up in the middle of the night to find her father still working hard at the translation jobs he took on the side. Once, a burglar broke in and stole a whole month's salary that her father had just withdrawn from the ATM.

""Thanks to the sacrifices of my parents, the kindness shown by many and the quality of the Singapore education system, I've been able to go on to study at some of the best universities in the world and then work for some of the best companies in the world,"" she said.

Ms Mariam, who is Singapore managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group, has a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Master in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

The vice-chairman of the Woodlands Community Club management committee is married with no children.

She said she is passionate about early childhood education as she believes primary school is too late to start pushing for social mobility.

If she were to speak now to a young girl growing up in a rental flat like herself, she said, she would ask her to ""go out and be aggressive about what you want. Find your allies and your supporters"".

""Don't be afraid, don't limit yourself to thinking you can only take certain kinds of jobs. You can be a senior banker, you can be a law partner. We have it in this country to provide opportunities for everyone.""

Director for enterprise development at Temasek International

Mr Huang spent 19 years with the Republic of Singapore Air Force, where he began as a pilot trainee.

He was subsequently sent to the United States Air Force Academy and graduated with a degree in aeronautical engineering with distinction. He was the first non-American top graduate in military performance.

The father of two is now a director for enterprise development at Temasek International, the management and investment arm of state investment firm Temasek Holdings.

He has spent the last decade volunteering in Taman Jurong constituency, mentoring children from low-income homes and helping former prison inmates restart their lives.

He has also chaired the Community Arts and Culture Club, which holds arts and culture activities for residents.

""Art is the bedrock of civilisation,"" he said.

For him, digitalisation is the greatest leveller when it comes to social mobility, and he hopes to push for further growth of e-commerce and improvements to home-based learning.

Ms Chan Hui Yuh, 44

Marketing director

Ms Chan assisted the PAP in Aljunied GRC in the 2015 general election, but did not stand as a candidate then because her two children were too young.

Now that they are in primary and secondary school respectively, she decided it is time to enter politics.

She began grassroots work in Siglap in 2000, later becoming the chairman of the Siglap Citizens' Consultative Committee.

In 2015, she moved to become an adviser to Aljunied Grassroots Organisations.

The mother of two, who works as a marketing director at Jingslink Marketing, hopes to speak up for low-income families.

""We have women who, because they have to look after their children, cannot go out to work, so we need to have more childcare facilities and negotiate affordable childcare so women can have peace of mind to go out and earn living,"" she said.

Ms Carrie Tan, 38

Founding executive director of charity Daughters of Tomorrow

Ms Tan, the second daughter of a taxi driver-turned-contractor and a housewife, left the private sector in 2012 to set up social enterprise Daughters of Tomorrow, which helps underprivileged women in Singapore sustain their livelihoods.

She previously worked in the advertising industry before setting up her sole proprietorship consultancy, providing headhunting and talent development services in Singapore and Shanghai.

""I think we need innovation for the country beyond the scale of the economy... as well as in areas of technology,"" said Ms Tan, who is single and has been walking the ground in Nee Soon GRC.

""I hope to bring my experience and my skills in community building into politics and create a slightly different space where, beyond the efficiency of solving problems, we can create a space for people's feelings to be valued and acknowledged,"" she said.

She added that ""certain people or groups in society... may feel that the Government may be a little bit high-handed at times"".

""I think it's very normal when people are required to perform under pressure and to solve problems. I feel that by being in politics, I can bring my brand of care and empathy to the way politics is discussed, especially in this age of social media, and also in Parliament.""",0.34743598993599,0.09524107836607833,Positive

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat yesterday lifted the curtain on the party's selection process when he introduced a new group of fresh faces for the polls on July 10.

Mr Heng, who is the PAP's first assistant secretary-general, said: ""What we hope to have is a team that is sufficiently diverse for us to reach out to all Singaporeans from different segments of our society, different walks of life, different professions.""

However, that is not enough because Singapore society is becoming increasingly diverse, he noted, pointing out that even just looking at jobs alone, there are so many different areas.

Hence, it also looks at causes that people are interested in, he added.

""There are so many of them. And that is why it is important for us to reach out as much as possible to different groups.

""But the key thing is that we want people of integrity. We want people with a strong sense of service, who feel that they are ready and prepared to contribute to bringing our people together, both in serving our citizens at the front line as an MP and, at the same time, even if they continue their professional work, to serve in Parliament, to speak up in the various debates and deliberations, because that's where long-term policies are being made.""

Initially, the candidates' track record, ability and experience are scrutinised, Mr Heng said at a virtual press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road.

They then go through a ""very rigorous selection process, starting from informal chit-chats to more formal tea sessions to selections by our selection committee"", which is chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

Finally, they are approved by the PAP secretary-general, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

Mr Heng said the four fresh faces he introduced yesterday had modest upbringings. They included Dr Tan See Leng, former managing director of IHH Healthcare, and Mr Tan Kiat How, former chief executive of the Infocomm Media Development Authority.

""But Singapore's conditions of education and providing opportunities enabled them to be their best (and) achieve what they set out to do,"" he said. ""Creating that condition remains a very critical factor if we want Singapore to continue to progress.""

The quartet also share a common purpose for entering politics - to improve Singaporeans' lives, he said.

Their concerns range from the needs of seniors to the young, he added. ""And we want to create conditions that allow our young to be able to fulfil their potential. We want to be able to create conditions to look after our seniors even better.""

Mr Heng added that the four have played various roles in unifying people. ""They have been involved in one way or another in mobilising our people, our various communities to come together to achieve more than what we could have done individually... This is very much the spirit of Singapore Together that I've been speaking about.""

At a separate press conference yesterday, PAP vice-chairman Masagos Zulkifli also introduced four new candidates.

Three other new candidates were introduced by the party's organising secretary Grace Fu in another session.

Mr Masagos, who is Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, said candidates such as polytechnic lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, whom he introduced, epitomise ""the new Malay-Muslim leadership"" that start by serving in their community but do not stop there. Dr Wan Rizal was chairman of Al-Islah mosque in Punggol and subsequently became a grassroots leader in Pasir Ris East and Punggol East.

Related Story Singapore GE2020: Political parties begin unveiling new faces

Ms Fu, who is Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, replying to a question on the PAP's efforts to get more women into the party, said more will be participating in this election.

Out of the 26 candidates the party will introduce, 10 are women - double the number it fielded in 2015.

It is a trend the party is ""very happy to see"", she said, adding that engaging women and encouraging them to join the PAP involves the work of both men and women.

""Women these days are well educated, they are well represented across sectors.

""So wherever we go, whether it's engaging trade associations, whether it's in the people sector, my male colleagues and my female colleagues are always looking for promising candidates. And if they are women, all the better.""

When identified, the party's women MPs will get in touch with them to find out what issues they are passionate about and encourage them to participate.

When the women are ready and their family and career allow for it, they will step forward as PAP candidates, Ms Fu said.

Even if they do not want to be MPs, the party is still very happy to have them help out as activists and supporters, she added.

TAN KIAT HOW, 43

Former IMDA chief executive

Mr Tan was ""the pioneer of the Pioneer Generation Office"", said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in introducing him yesterday. Tipped to be fielded in East Coast GRC, Mr Tan was part of the team that set up the office, now known as the Silver Generation Office, and responsible for mobilising 3,000 volunteers to reach out to nearly half a million seniors.

He took up the top post at the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in 2017. Under his leadership, the organisation took steps to build up Singapore's connectivity infrastructure, such as the roll-out of the country's fourth telco.

Previously, he was deputy secretary (cyber and technology) at the Ministry of Communications and Information, where he worked on the national cyber-security strategy.

Digitalisation is an issue close to his heart, said Mr Tan, whose father is a retired army regular and mother a nurse.

He and his wife are expecting their first child, a boy, in August. ""That has made me more conscious and reflective of the kind of society and kind of Singapore I want to build up. Helping workers, businesses to use technology to create more opportunities and for a better life is making sure that no one is left behind in a digital future,"" he said.

YEO WAN LING, 44

Chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia

Ms Yeo, who used to work at the Economic Development Board, now runs Caregiver Asia, a social enterprise that connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers in Singapore.

She started her social enterprise because she saw a gap in the provision of home-care services, in particular long-term care for the elderly.

Ms Yeo said her grandmother had been ill for a number of years before she died, and it was while being with her during her twilight years that ""I realised the importance of being able to grow old with grace and dignity"".

She hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly in Singapore to continue to work or contribute to the community. She has been tipped to stand in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

Ms Yeo, who is married, said politics is a platform that will bridge her experiences in the civil service and in the community. ""(It'll allow me to be) able to influence not just day-to-day operations of helping people, but also bring it up to a larger platform such that I can (have an impact on) national policies.""

ALVIN TAN SHENG HUI, 39

Head of public policy and economics (Asia-Pacific) at LinkedIn

Mr Tan was once held back a grade, and did not do well enough at school to enter a local university.

Despite the setbacks, he earned an economics degree from Sydney University, and later, a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University.

He has worked in the Singapore Armed Forces, with non-profit group Oxfam, as well as in investment banking.

He is now with social networking platform LinkedIn.

Mr Tan, who is married with two children, has been a grassroots volunteer in Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng since 2005, and has also been active in Tanjong Pagar GRC lately.

Mr Tan said he hopes to use his skills and experience in the public, private and non-profit sectors to help Singaporeans become more nimble and prepared for the future of work.

He also aims to do more to bridge the digital divide for seniors and other vulnerable groups.

Said Mr Tan: ""(If) by the time Covid-19 is over and we haven't changed, we haven't been comfortable with technology, I think we might have failed our people.""

The Normal (Academic) stream student obtained a polytechnic diploma and later enrolled at the National Institute of Education, and subsequently, at Nanyang Technological University, where he obtained his degree in physical education at the age of 31. He now holds a PhD in sports science.

Dr Wan Rizal, who has recently appeared at Jalan Besar GRC events, said: ""Because of the non-linear path that I have taken, I strongly believe that education is the key to social mobility. This is how we can allow people who have less, or did less well, to move up and prevent our society from being stratified.""

""Singapore must continue to be a nation of opportunities for all - not for just the privileged few, or the lucky ones, but for every Singaporean.""

Former director of the SGSecure Programme Office

Mr Chua grew up in a three-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. His father was a forklift driver and his mother a seamstress and, later, a production operator in a factory.

He was awarded the Local Merit Scholarship (Civil Defence) by the Public Service Commission to read communications studies at Nanyang Technological University. He served with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), eventually becoming commander of the 3rd SCDF Division before joining the SGSecure Programme Office.

Mr Chua, a former chairman of the People's Association Youth Movement's Central Youth Council, has worked with youth for 15 years. He is also father to a baby boy, who was born about a week ago.

He said he was fortunate to have siblings, friends, supervisors and mentors who helped him grow in life. ""This is time for me to step up and pay it forward... If elected, one of several areas I'll like to focus on is to ensure that youth, especially those from humble family backgrounds like mine, will continue to have a fair chance to succeed in life,"" he said.

Former Parkway Holdings group chief executive

Dr Tan See Leng, who has spent more than 30 years in the medical sector, is the oldest PAP candidate introduced so far and will succeed Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong as chairman of Marine Parade's PAP branch.

He said he spent two years under Mr Goh's tutelage, and worked with him on a caregiver support network for the elderly that will be launched after the election.

He declined to comment on where he will be fielded.

Dr Tan, the only child of a bus timekeeper and a housewife, grew up in a Toa Payoh rental flat. A family physician by training, he has three children in their 20s.

He is fluent in English and Mandarin, as well as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien.

He said the deaths of his parents from cancer in the 2000s, after years of chronic illness, strengthened his resolve to get a master's in family medicine, followed by a Master of Business Administration.

He is currently a corporate adviser to Temasek Holdings and adviser to DBS Bank, as well as an independent director of Surbana Jurong.

He was the former group chief executive and managing director of private hospital operator IHH Healthcare.

NG LING LING, 48

Former managing director of Community Chest

Ms Ng Ling Ling spent six years working in banking, but gave that up to go into social service.

Growing up in a three-room Housing Board flat in Hougang, she watched some of her neighbours struggle with problems such as drug abuse: ""I was always very sensitive to the plight of the families I saw.""

As managing director of Community Chest (ComChest), the National Council of Social Service's fund-raising arm, she helped raise millions for charity.

She stepped down from her role as chief of future primary care and director of community engagement at the Health Ministry's Office for Healthcare Transformation at the end of March. She is now a senior consultant there.

She said she had been working on innovating new care models, such as using simple technology to help people with high blood pressure understand the disease and guard against strokes.

""I see the importance of long-term holistic care, as our population ages rapidly,"" said Ms Ng, who is married and has a son in primary school.

She has helped bring in tele-health systems for Covid-19 community care facilities, and said she will continue to be part of the fight against the virus.

Ms Ng is tipped to be fielded in Ang Mo Kio GRC.

ZHULKARNAIN ABDUL RAHIM, 39

Lawyer

Mr Zhulkarnain, a partner at law firm Dentons Rodyk and Davidson, believes in building on community modes of distribution, such as neighbour networks to support the needy, and to ""entrench this idea of humanness"" in policymaking.

Over the last decade, the father of three children aged 11, eight and six has conducted free legal clinics and done pro bono work as an assigned solicitor with the Legal Aid Bureau. He was previously the chairman of the Association of Muslim Professionals.

The Straits Times reported earlier that he has been spotted walking the ground in Chua Chu Kang GRC.

Mr Zhulkarnain is the fifth of six children. His mother is a housewife and his father did blue-collar jobs before joining a construction company and working his way up to be a supervisor.

""From him, I remember the importance of lifelong learning,"" said Mr Zhulkarnain, who would go through his father's presentation slides with him as his father did not know how to use PowerPoint.

""The Covid-19 circuit breaker period has shown up various digital inequalities among our people, such as those who cannot afford digital devices to do home-based learning,"" he said.

""But what I feel is that beyond digital connectivity, it is human connectivity that we would have to look at in terms of policymaking and process.""

RAYMOND LYE HOONG YIP, 54

Managing partner at Union Law LLP

Mr Lye, a father of three and a lawyer, has been volunteering in the community for 25 years.

When introducing himself, he recounted how he and other volunteers helped a low-income resident deal with a problem.

Mr Lye, who chairs the Punggol East Citizens' Consultative Committee, said the resident's daughter had obtained a university scholarship from an agency. But the agency, which he did not name, later asked the resident to cough up a large sum of money as her daughter's grades were not good.

Mr Lye said that after several attempts, he and other volunteers managed to get the agency to write off the sum and the family was later able to save up enough money to buy their own flat and move out of the rental block.

Despite having volunteered for groups like clan societies and trade associations, Mr Lye said he finds community work most fulfilling.

""I have always tried my best to help, as no government policy is foolproof and there are those who may fall through the cracks,"" said Mr Lye, who has been volunteering in the new Sengkang GRC.

DERRICK GOH SOON HEE, 51

Managing director and head of group audit at DBS Bank

Before taking up his position at DBS, Mr Goh headed its subsidiary POSB, where he said he was exposed to volunteering efforts by community leaders and grassroots organisations.

This inspired the father of three to take up community work.

Mr Goh spent more than 10 years at credit firm American Express and was based in London and New York. He hopes to tap his experience in banking to help improve the lives of Singaporeans.

""I know that Singapore is not perfect but having lived in all these international financial centres, I can say that Singapore is the best. Therefore, I want to play a role to help Singapore adapt as the world changes very rapidly, given digitisation and the onset of the impact of new technology,"" he said.

Since 2013, Mr Goh has been volunteering as a district councillor with the South West Community Development Council and also serves on the board of HomeTeamNS.

Mr Goh, who is vice-chairman of the Gambas-Yishun Citizens' Consultative Committee, has been seen with Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam at community engagements in Nee Soon GRC, where he is expected to be fielded.

POH LI SAN, 44

Vice-president for Terminal 5 planning at Changi Airport Group

Sembawang is a special place for Ms Poh, a former helicopter pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the first female full-time aide-de-camp to the late President S R Nathan.

She spent a lot of time there when she was based at RSAF's Sembawang Air Base.

""Now that I have a chance to go back to Sembawang to serve on the ground, I'm really excited to work closely with our volunteers, with our residents there,"" said Ms Poh, who started volunteering in grassroots activities in Sembawang GRC in 2018.

Ms Poh, who is single, started an annual Women Festival for the constituency and helped distribute food to rental flat residents.

Ms Poh, who spoke in Mandarin, English and Malay at the press conference, is tipped to join the PAP team for Sembawang GRC, which will likely lose Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan as he is expected to retire from politics soon.

The 82-year-old, who has been living in Marine Parade for 39 years, said she was hoping he would contest the coming general election. ""He is very caring and takes good care of the elderly,"" she said. ""His stepping down will sadden many residents.""

She recalled vividly how Mr Goh had come to her rescue in 1981 when she felt so helpless after she failed to get a permit to hire a maid.

Madam Chua had just moved to Marine Parade to start a provision shop business and needed a helper to take care of her two children.

Mr Goh helped to write a letter to the authorities to support her case and she got the permit, she said.

Like Madam Chua, many Marine Parade residents were expecting Mr Goh to stand again.

""Marine Parade has always been a stronghold for PAP because of Goh Chok Tong,"" said Mr Marican A.J., 75, a resident of more than 30 years who saw the area develop into a mature estate.

""Mr Goh is a sentimental person. Instead of demolishing the old flats, he upgraded them. There are also more clinics to take care of the elderly living here,"" he added.

Mr Ronnie Foo, 57, who runs a fruit stall, added: ""He has done so much for us. He is a very down-to-earth MP and he understands the issues we face.

""When hawkers like me get summonses, we go to see him. He would help us write appeal letters because he knows it's not easy for us to do our business,"" he said. ""It would be hard for you to find someone who says Mr Goh is not a nice person.""

Mr Goh has been grooming Dr Tan See Leng, 55, who was introduced as a new candidate yesterday, to take over as chairman of the People's Action Party (PAP) branch in Marine Parade.

Mr Goh will remain chairman emeritus of the branch, and has also agreed to be appointed senior adviser to the People's Association on a pro bono basis.

In a valedictory letter to Mr Goh, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that he oversaw the transformation of Marine Parade estate on newly reclaimed land to a vibrant waterfront town filled with warmth. ""The story of Marine Parade is the story of Singapore - out of nothing, we created something special. You made that happen,"" he said.

In a Facebook post, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat recalled Mr Goh giving him valuable advice during the 2008 global financial crisis when he was deliberating on getting approval from then-President S R Nathan for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits here, to be backed by reserves.

Mr Heng was managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Mr Goh, its chairman.

Mr Heng said he was glad to have Mr Goh's counsel. ""He taught us that we must face difficult decisions head-on. Having thought through the options, we must have the courage to do what is right,"" he wrote. ""It was a lesson that stayed with me and continues to guide much of my work.""

Specifically, it involves a planned handover to the PAP's fourth generation of leaders since Singapore's independence in 1965.

Mr Goh Chok Tong, 79, has been a Member of Parliament for 44 years. He stepped down from Cabinet in 2011 and has been known as Emeritus Senior Minister since then.

Even as he departs the political stage, he has signalled his continued preoccupation with Singapore's future, asking in a cryptic Facebook post on Tuesday, the day the election was called: ""Parliament dissolved. Quo vadis, Singapore? Quo vadis, me?""

""Quo vadis"" is a Latin phrase commonly translated as ""Where are you going?"" or, more poetically, ""Whither goest thou?""

Mr Goh announced his decision to retire in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.

PM Lee accepted his decision and thanked Mr Goh for a lifetime of distinguished service.

Born into a working class family in 1941, the man who stood out from childhood - not just because he was the tallest among his peers - began his working life as a civil servant who went on to lead Neptune Orient Lines before being inducted into politics in 1976, at the age of 35.

He rose swiftly to helm several ministries, including Trade and Industry, Health and Defence, before being appointed deputy prime minister in 1985. Five years later, he succeeded Mr Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister.

GROWTH AND RENEWAL

When he was sworn in as prime minister on Nov 28, 1990, he pledged to make sure ""Singapore thrives and grows after Mr Lee Kuan Yew"".

During his 14 years at the helm, Singapore's per capita gross domestic product grew from $21,950 in 1990 to more than $38,000 in 2004. A web of free trade agreements (FTAs), including with major economies like the United States and Japan, expanded the island nation's political and economic space overseas.

At home, the Goh years were about renewing the bond between people and government on terms that the second-generation PAP leaders believed in - a kinder, gentler nation, a government that listened, and paid attention not just to material well-being but also matters of the heart, or ""heartware"".

Mr Goh played a key role in regional integration, working to narrow the development gap between the original Asean five and the newer member states of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. This was done through the Initiative for Asean Integration (IAI) launched in 2000.

He sparked an ""India fever"" in Singapore in the 1990s, making multiple trips to the country, urging it to forge closer ties with the region and pushing for the conclusion of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca).

He also led Singapore's efforts to grow links between world regions, through the Asia-Europe Meeting, the Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation and Asia-Middle East Dialogue. These cemented Singapore's cultural, economic and political relevance to the world.

As prime minister, it also fell to him to secure a team to succeed himself and his peers in Cabinet.

During his tenure as minister for defence, Mr Goh talent-spotted a young Lee Hsien Loong, then a Singapore Armed Forces leader, and persuaded him to enter politics and stand for election in 1984.

PM Lee himself spoke of Mr Goh's ability to get capable people to join his team and work for him, when he launched the latter's biography Tall Order in 2018.

PM Lee said of his predecessor: ""He nurtures and holds the team together. He considers and takes in their views, and gets the best out of the team.""

It was Mr Goh who brought in key third-generation leaders, including Mr George Yeo, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, as well as Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Professor Yaacob Ibrahim and Mr Lim Swee Say. In his speech, PM Lee observed that Mr Goh had assembled ""some of the strongest Cabinets Singapore has had"" at a time when the task of governing Singapore had become more complex.

KINDER AND GENTLER

At home, the Goh years were about renewing the bond between people and government on terms that the second-generation PAP leaders believed in - a kinder, gentler nation, a government that listened, and paid attention not just to material well-being but also matters of the heart, or ""heartware"".

Mr Goh set up the Feedback Unit for Singaporeans to share their views on policies. He launched two national engagement efforts to tap the views and ideas of thousands of Singaporeans - the first in 1997 called Singapore 21, the second in 2001 called Remaking Singapore.

He used budget surpluses to set up endowment funds that to this day provide financial support to less well-off Singaporeans. These range from the Edusave scheme that awards grants and scholarships to students, Medifund which helps poorer Singaporeans foot their healthcare bills, the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to enhance workers' employability, and Eldercare for those needing nursing homes and other long-term care services.

It was also during Mr Goh's tenure that the Government first started redistributing budget surpluses to citizens in the form of Central Provident Fund top-ups.

At the grassroots level, Mr Goh set up community development councils, inter-racial confidence circles and harmony circles to promote social bonding and cohesion among different racial and religious communities.

He oversaw political innovations such as government parliamentary committees which give backbencher MPs a platform to scrutinise policies, as well as the Nominated MP scheme, which remains a key channel for independent, non-partisan individuals to con-tribute their views in Singapore's Parliament.

Despite his friendly mien and famously dry wit, and his stated goal of nurturing a kinder, gentler Singapore, Mr Goh could be tough in political contests and towards his critics. In 1994, he censured writer Catherine Lim for her article on an ""affective divide"" between the Government and Singaporeans due to its top-down approach to governing. Dr Lim had gone ""beyond the pale"", Mr Goh said, adding that those who wished to comment regularly on politics should enter the political arena.

When it came to electoral battles, Mr Goh fought hard to win, leading the ruling party to victory in three general elections in 1991, 1997 and 2001. The last campaign saw the PAP win 75 per cent of the votes in the midst of an economic crisis due to the fallout of the Sept 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Throughout those years, he stood firm in the face of criticism against the government policy of placing opposition wards last in the queue for HDB estate upgrading.

NO GUARANTEES

Having dedicated his life to serving Singapore, Mr Goh naturally worries about the sustainability of its success.

In recent years, he has voiced concern about the lack of diversity among ministers and the resulting ""groupthink"" that might affect the quality of leadership. His concern stems from the growing share of PAP ministers drawn from the ranks of the public service, including the armed forces. At the same time, he has noted that it is increasingly difficult for the PAP to attract talented people from the private sector into politics.

Another concern is the sustainability of PAP rule - unbroken since 1959.

In 2017, at a dinner to mark his 40 years as MP for Marine Parade, Mr Goh reminded PAP activists not to take voters' support for granted.

The PAP won 56.6 per cent of the votes in Marine Parade GRC in GE2011, on the back of a national slide in the party's vote share, and improved this result with a 64.1 per cent showing in GE2015. But Mr Goh's appeal meant it consistently got a higher percentage of votes in his Marine Parade ward.

""Going forward, we must not assume that we will always poll more than 70 per cent in our Marine Parade ward. We should not even assume that we will always win,"" said Mr Goh.

Younger voters have a ""less instinctive, and more transactional"" bond with the party, he added, compared with the pioneer gene-ration who lived through Singapore's early struggles. As for the opposition, he said he hoped to see one that was ""intelligent, constructive, critical"".

While no longer an MP, Mr Goh has set himself one more political task, and that is to complete the second volume of his biography, entitled Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story.

That at least provides part of the answer to one of the two questions he posed this week. As for the other, ""Quo vadis, Singapore?"" the answer is a work in progress, though the outcome of the upcoming campaign may provide some clues.",0.3438225478225477,0.08356878306878304,Positive

Among those who will not contest the July 10 polls is the country's second prime minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, who informed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of his decision on Wednesday.

Mr Goh, 79, was an MP for 44 straight years and served as prime minister from 1990 to 2004.

On the other side of the political divide, former Workers' Party (WP) chief Low Thia Khiang bowed out of politics yesterday after 29 years in Parliament, the longest by any opposition MP in Singapore.

WP secretary-general Pritam Singh announced that Mr Low, 63, and two-term MPs Chen Show Mao, 59, and Png Eng Huat, 58, would not be standing in the polls.

The departures come as Singapore gears up for a general election in which leadership transition is a key issue, with the People's Action Party (PAP) fourth-generation leadership set to take the helm.

PM Lee lauded Mr Goh for his calm and steady leadership during crises like the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003.

PM Lee said Mr Goh left his biggest imprint in Marine Parade, where he was first elected in 1976 and re-elected in nine general elections and one by-election.

He added in a Facebook post: ""I am forever personally indebted to Chok Tong, who brought me into politics. Ours was a fruitful comradeship that spanned the entirety of my years in politics and most of his - a close friendship between two prime ministers that would be the envy of many countries.""

In his letter, Mr Goh said many of his activists have urged him to stand for another term. ""But I should not. I would not have the same energy when I cross into my 80s,"" he wrote, adding that smooth and systematic leadership succession is key to Singapore's political stability.

And just as he decided to hand over the reins to PM Lee in 2004, Mr Goh said he prefers to retire now while he is healthy and able, to ease his successor's transition into his Marine Parade ward.

EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY Chok Tong has had an extraordinary political journey. He became MP for Marine Parade at 35, where he has served since 1976! He held multiple portfolios before being asked by his fellow ministers (including me) to be Singapore's second Prime Minister, and he did not let Singapore down. PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG, in a Facebook post.

He assured residents that Marine Parade will be in ""very capable hands"" under Dr Tan See Leng, 55, the former group chief executive and managing director of IHH Healthcare.

Dr Tan was one of 11 new PAP candidates unveiled yesterday, along with former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43. Both men are said to be potential office-holders.

Meanwhile, the WP introduced four candidates, while the Progress Singapore Party unveiled another five candidates, including two retired Singapore Armed Forces officers.

Mr Low, himself, told the media he was stepping down with no regrets as he felt his work was done. ""I have always maintained that a party cannot depend on just an individual or a few individuals,"" he said.

In a Facebook post yesterday, President Halimah Yacob said that although Mr Goh and Mr Low serve on opposite ends of the political spectrum, their mutual respect for each other is well known.

It is thus an ""uncanny coincidence"" that they announced their respective decisions to retire from politics on the same day, she wrote.

She added that Mr Goh - who persuaded her to enter politics 20 years ago - has made tremendous contributions to Singapore, while Mr Low has been a voice of reason among the opposition.

""To many Singaporeans, today's announcements mark the end of an era,"" she said.

ESM Goh's letter to PM Lee:

24 June 2020

Mr Lee Hsien Loong

Prime Minister, Republic of Singapore

Secretary-General, People's Action Party

Dear Prime Minister,

As Parliament has now been dissolved, I write to inform you that I have decided not to stand in the coming General Elections. Having served as a Member of Parliament for Marine Parade for over four decades, I make this decision after much thought and with a heavy heart.

Marine Parade is my second home. I love the people. The PAP Branch activists and the grassroots leaders are my steadfast comrades and firm friends. Many have urged me to stand for another term. But I should not. I would not have the same energy when I cross into my 80s.

Smooth and systematic leadership succession is the key to Singapore's political stability. I decided to step down as PM in 2004 after the economy had recovered from Sars and when you were in place to take over as my successor. Similarly, I prefer to retire as Member of Parliament now whilst I am healthy and able to ease my successor's transition into Marine Parade.

Dr Tan See Leng has been understudying me for nearly two years now. He helps me with my Meet-the-People Sessions, and with several social projects that I initiated in the constituency. He is now operationalising our Caregiver Support Network, an important new initiative for a mature estate like Marine Parade. He has also played an active role in EduGrow, our youth mentorship programme for students from lower-income families. See Leng connects well with residents, Branch members and grassroots leaders alike. He has held dialogues with residents and gone on house visits until Covid-19 put a stop to them. I recommend him to take over from me.

Competent and trusted leaders with the heart for public service are critical to protect and advance Singaporeans' interests. We need more lion-hearted people to secure Singapore's place in an increasingly turbulent world.

I strongly support your planned leadership succession at the national level. The 4G team led by Heng Swee Keat has been tested and strengthened in the crucible of Covid-19. We must look for more good men and women to join the team.

Likewise, we should start building up the core of the 5G team.

I hope you will accept my decision to step down as Member of Parliament.

It has been my greatest honour and privilege to have served the Party, residents of Marine Parade, Singapore and Singaporeans for the past 44 years.

I will continue to contribute to Singapore in other ways.

Best wishes for a successful General Election ahead.

Yours fraternally,

GOH CHOK TONG

PM Lee's reply to ESM Goh:

25 June 2020

Mr Goh Chok Tong

Emeritus Senior Minister

Prime Minister's Office

Singapore

Dear Chok Tong,

Thank you for your letter of 24 June 2020. With sadness, I accept your decision to retire from politics at the forthcoming General Election.

Singapore is going through a difficult time because of Covid-19. But we have experienced crises before, including when you were Prime Minister, such as the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, the September 2001 terrorist attacks, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. On those occasions, your calm and steady leadership gave Singaporeans comfort and courage. Those crises were painful experiences that left their mark on us, but they strengthened us too. This gives us confidence that this time with Covid-19, we will again emerge stronger.

Your contributions continued after you stepped down as PM. In Parliament, you weighed in during key debates, including on integrated resorts and ministerial salaries. You guided the younger MPs, providing them with historical perspective, and inculcating in them the values and ethic of public service. You also served as Chairman and remain Senior Adviser of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, guiding MAS to enhance the resilience of the banking system, strengthen links with international partners, promote innovation, and protect retail consumers.

Internationally, you built bridges for our people, opened doors for our businesses, and flew our flag high. When Myanmar opened up in 2011, your personal relationship with their leaders gave our companies an entry to seize the economic opportunities there. You initiated the Tianjin Eco-City and Guangzhou Knowledge City, creating new platforms for Singapore to collaborate with China. In India, without the trust and goodwill you built up over many years, I could not have signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca) in 2005.

It is in Marine Parade that you have left the most personal imprint on the lives of individual Singaporeans. You were returned as the MP for Marine Parade eleven times, in ten general elections and one by-election over almost 45 years. When you were first elected in 1976, Marine Parade was newly reclaimed land - a large but blank canvas on which our hopes and dreams could be projected. Today, those dreams have become reality. Marine Parade has become a vibrant waterfront town filled with warmth, which people of all ages are proud to call home. The story of Marine Parade is the story of Singapore - out of nothing, we created something special. You made that happen.

In the process, you built lifelong friendships with your grassroots leaders, and an unbreakable bond with your residents. They know that you always have their welfare at heart. In the early days you proposed setting up Residents' Committees (RCS) in Marine Parade to build communities in our neighbourhoods and precincts. The project succeeded, and today we have replicated that structure island-wide with more than 800 RCs and Neighbourhood Committees.

After leaving the Cabinet, you devoted even more time and energy to your constituency. Residents from other parts of the GRC would often meet you at Meet-the-People Sessions, as you joined your fellow MPs to help residents in their branches. You raised funds to start numerous social programmes, including the Marine Parade Leadership Foundation to train future community leaders, WeCare @ MarineParade to help vulnerable residents, and EduGrow for kindergarten and primary school students from disadvantaged family backgrounds. These projects inspired national programmes like the Youth Corps Singapore, the SG Cares Community Network, and the UPLIFT programme which MOE is now rolling out across Singapore. You also founded the Mediacorp Enable Fund to help persons with disabilities fulfil their aspirations.

Grassroots leaders and residents in Marine Parade will miss you. But like me, they understand and respect your decision to retire, because they have seen you advocate and uphold the principle of leadership renewal all your life. As PAP Secretary-General, you were tireless in bringing in fresh blood to the party. In 2004 when you relinquished the Prime Ministership, and in 2011 when you left the Cabinet, you still had much more to give. But you decided that it was in the party's interest, and especially in the national interest, to let someone younger take over.

I will always be personally indebted to you. You brought me into politics and have guided and mentored me all these years. It was my privilege to be your deputy throughout your premiership. After you retired from Cabinet, we continued with our regular lunches. I always looked forward to these opportunities to share my thoughts and concerns candidly with someone who fully understood what was at stake, and to hear your reactions and perspectives. Your advice, based on a lifetime of experience, helped me clarify my thoughts and avoid many unnecessary errors. Ours was a fruitful comradeship that spanned the entirety of my years in politics and most of yours - a close relationship between two prime ministers that would be the envy of many countries.

In the PAP Marine Parade Branch, I am glad the succession is well in hand, and Dr Tan See Leng will be taking over as Branch Chairman. I am also glad that you will maintain your links with Marine Parade, as Chairman Emeritus of the Marine Parade Branch and Adviser Emeritus to Marine Parade GROs. At the national level you have agreed to be appointed Senior Adviser to the People's Association on a pro bono basis. I am happy that you will continue to chair the Governing Board of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. This will enable you to continue to contribute the insights and experience you have accumulated all these years.

On behalf of all Singaporeans, I thank you for a lifetime of distinguished service. You have given your all and more in the service of your country and people. I wish you and Mrs Goh a long, healthy and happy retirement.

Yours sincerely,

Mr Goh, who was prime minister from 1990 to 2004, announced his decision in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (June 24) and PM Lee has accepted his decision to retire from politics.

In his reply on Thursday (June 25), PM Lee thanked Mr Goh for a lifetime of distinguished service, on behalf of all Singaporeans.

The exchange of letters was released by the Prime Minister's Office on Thursday.

Mr Goh said it has been his greatest honour and privilege to have served the People's Action Party, residents of Marine Parade, as well as Singapore and Singaporeans over the past 44 years. He added that he will continue to contribute in other ways.

In a Facebook post on Thursday afternoon, Mr Goh said: ""Residents, party comrades and grassroots leaders have urged me to stand once more in the coming GE. It is with a heavy heart that I have decided not to. Although I am still healthy, I worry I will not have the same energy to serve after I become an octogenarian next year (sounds old, doesn't it?). It will not be fair to you.""

Mr Goh assured residents that Marine Parade will be in ""very capable hands"" under his successor in the constituency, Dr Tan See Leng.

Mr Goh said Dr Tan, 55, who has been understudying him for two years, has the ""right character, temperament, motivations, values and competence to be your next MP"". Dr Tan will succeed Mr Goh as PAP Marine Parade Branch chairman.

In his reply to Mr Goh's letter, PM Lee said he is glad Mr Goh's succession is well in hand. Said PM Lee: ""It is in Marine Parade that you have left the most personal imprint on the lives of individual Singaporeans. You were returned as the MP for Marine Parade eleven times, in ten general elections and one by-election over almost 45 years.

""The story of Marine Parade is the story of Singapore - out of nothing, we created something special. You made that happen.""

PM Lee acknowledged how Mr Goh had continued to contribute to Singapore's growth after he stepped down as PM - from inculcating the values and ethics of public service in younger MPs to guiding the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to enhance the resilience of the banking system, strengthen links with international partners, promote innovation, and protect retail consumers.

PM Lee also recognised Mr Goh's efforts in building good relationships with foreign leaders which in turn created opportunities for Singapore businesses.

In a Facebook post on Thursday, PM Lee added: ""I am forever personally indebted to Chok Tong, who brought me into politics. Ours was a fruitful comradeship that spanned the entirety of my years in politics and most of his - a close friendship between two prime ministers that would be the envy of many countries.""

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, in a Facebook post, recalled how Mr Goh had given him very valuable advice during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, when he was deliberating hard on whether to seek approval from the President for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits in Singapore, to be backed by past reserves.

Mr Heng was then the managing director of MAS and Mr Goh its chairman.

""I was glad to have the wise counsel of ESM Goh. He taught us that we must face difficult decisions head-on. Having thought through the options, we must have the courage to do what is right. It was a lesson that stayed with me and continues to guide much of my work,"" wrote Mr Heng.

In a Facebook post, Speaker of the 13th Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin thanked Mr Goh for being a great mentor, describing him as a ""down-to-earth person with a mischievous sense of humour"" who looks out for those around him and his residents.

Mr Goh, an economist by training, joined the Government's Administrative Service in 1964 and joined national shipping company Neptune Orient Lines in 1969, becoming its managing director from 1973 to 1977.

He entered politics in 1976 and was first elected to Parliament as MP for Marine Parade in the 1976 general election.

He was re-elected in nine subsequent general elections, and served as Minister for Trade and Industry, Health and Defence between 1979 and 1990. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in 1985, and succeeded Mr Lee Kuan Yew as Singapore's prime minister in November 1990.

Mr Goh relinquished the post of PM in August 2004 to Mr Lee Hsien Loong, and remained in the Cabinet as Senior Minister. He also served as chairman of MAS from 2004 to 2011.

He stepped down from Cabinet alongside Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew after the 2011 general election, and was given the honorary title of Emeritus Senior Minister.

He was also appointed Senior Advisor to MAS.

The latest batch of PAP candidates unveiled on Thursday (June 25) brings with them years of experience in community and volunteer work, on top of time spent in the civil service or corporate world.

For instance, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, who used to work for the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), helps match caregivers to those who need one through a social enterprise.

Mr Alvin Tan is a long-time grassroots volunteer who works for tech giant LinkedIn.

He has been helping the elderly and young acquire digital skills amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Polytechnic lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah defied convention by going from the Normal stream to obtaining a PhD. He has been active for many years in inter-religious circles.

Former civil servant Eric Chua, who came from humble beginnings, has been working with young people for more than a decade. He won a scholarship from the Public Service Commission and rose up the ranks in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).

Speaking at a virtual press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road, PAP vice-chairman Masagos Zulkifli said the new candidates have gone through ""varied and interesting journeys"" in their lives.

At another virtual press conference on Thursday, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, who is also the PAPâ€™s organising secretary, introduced three other new faces, who are all from the private sector.

With these introductions, the PAP has so far unveiled 19 of the 26 new faces it is expected to field in the July 10 election.

Here are the seven PAP candidates introduced by Mr Masagos and Ms Fu:

Ms Yeo Wan Ling, 44, chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia

Ms Yeo was part of the global operations team at the EDB. She now runs Caregiver Asia, a social enterprise that connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers in Singapore. She said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly in Singapore to continue to work or contribute to the community.

Ms Yeo said one of the most meaningful things at EDB was â€œbeing able to work on projects that created and brought in very good and meaningful jobs for all Singaporeansâ€. She added that she started her social enterprise, as she saw a gap in the provision of home-care services, in particular long-term care for the elderly.

On why she left the civil service to start her own venture, she said: â€œMy grandmother... was ill for a number of years before she passed on. And it was spending her twilight years together with me that I realised the importance of being able to grow old with grace and dignity.â€

Ms Yeo said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly to continue to work or contribute to the community, and wants to champion caregiving programmes.

Ms Yeo, who is married, said: â€œPolitics allows me to bring together the type of experiences I have with the civil service, and working in the community... and to be able to influence not just day-to-day operations of helping people, but also to bring it up to a larger platform such that I can (have an impact on) national policies.â€

Mr Alvin Tan Sheng Hui, 39, Head of Public Policy and Economics at LinkedIn

Mr Tan has been a grassroots volunteer since 2005, working together with Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo in Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said he faced obstacles in his education journey â€“ he was once held back a grade, and did not do well enough to enter a local university.

Despite the earlier setbacks, he earned a Bachelor of Economics with First Class Honours from Sydney University, and later, a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University. He has worked at the Ministry of Defence, the United Nations and non-profit group Oxfam, as well as in investment banking. He is now in the technology sector - earlier at social media giant Facebook and now at social networking platform LinkedIn.

Mr Tan said he hopes to use his skills and experience in the public, private and non-profit sectors to help Singaporeans become more nimble and prepared for the future of work.

He said he also aims to bridge the digital divide for seniors and other vulnerable groups, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic has hastened the need for all Singaporeans to acquire such digital skills. Work is now being done to help these groups, and more needs to be done, he said.

Said Mr Tan: â€œBy the time Covid-19 is over... if we (still) havenâ€™t become comfortable with technology, I think we might have failed our people.

â€œAnd so I will continue to really tirelessly advocate, and go to the ground and help all our students, stallholders... prepare for the future of work that has come much sooner than any of us has expected.â€

Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 42, senior lecturer at Republic Polytechnic

Dr Wan Rizal, who is married with four children, started volunteering in the community in 2010. He was chairman of Al-Islah mosque in Punggol, and was also part of Punggol's Interracial and Religious Confidence Circle.

He was a student in the Normal (Academic) stream before obtaining a polytechnic diploma and enrolling in the National Institute of Education and later Nanyang Technological University, where he obtained his degree in physical education at the age of 31.

He said: â€œI hope to be the voice in Parliament that upholds social mobility. Because of the non-linear path that I had taken, I strongly believe that education is the key to social mobility. This is how we can allow people who have less, or did less well to move up and prevent our society from being stratified.

â€œSingapore must continue to be a nation of opportunities for all, not for just the privileged few, or the lucky ones, but for every Singaporean.â€

Singaporeâ€™s education system is on the right track, he said. He added that he hopes to be part of its further development. For instance, he said he sees the value of early childhood education, and the importance of providing multiple pathways for Singaporeans to continue developing their skills.

He also hopes to advocate for the sandwiched class, as well as those who may face difficulties juggling work and family life.

Mr Lye, a father of three, has been volunteering for 25 years.

When introducing himself, he recounted how he and other volunteers helped a low-income resident deal with a problem.

Mr Lye, who chairs the Punggol East Citizensâ€™ Consultative Committee, said the residentâ€™s daughter had obtained a scholarship from an unnamed agency that allowed her to enter university despite her familyâ€™s finances.

But the agency later asked the resident to cough up a large sum of money, as her daughterâ€™s grades were not good.

Mr Lye said that after several attempts, he and other volunteers managed to get the agency to write off the sum and the family was able to save up enough money to buy their own flat and move out of the rental block.

Despite having volunteered for groups like clan societies and trade associations, Mr Lye said that he finds community work most fulfilling. â€œMost satisfying for me is community work, where I get to listen to residents in their homes, their void decks and the coffee shops,â€ said Mr Lye, who has been volunteering in the new Sengkang GRC.

â€œI have always tried my best to help, as no government policy is foolproof and there are those who may fall through the cracks.â€

And now that I have a chance to go back to Sembawang to serve on the ground, Iâ€™m really excited to work closely with our volunteers with our residents there,â€ said Ms Poh, who started volunteering in grassroots activities and Meet-the-People sessions in Sembawang GRC in 2018.

Ms Poh, who is single, started an annual Women Festival for the constituency and also took part in distributing food to rental flat residents.

She is tipped to join the PAP team that will contest Sembawang GRC, which will likely lose Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan as he is expected to retire from politics soon.

MR DERRICK GOH SOON HEE, 51, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF GROUP AUDIT AT DBS BANK

Before taking up his position at DBS, Mr Goh headed its subsidary POSB, where he said he was exposed to volunteering efforts by community leaders and grassroots.

This inspired the father of three to take up community work.

Mr Goh spent more than 10 years at credit firm American Express, based in London and New York. He intends to use his experience from the international banking sector to help improve the lives of Singaporeans.

â€œI want to play a part to improve the system, to hone the system. And I know that Singapore is not perfect, but having lived in all these international financial centres, I can say personally that Singapore is the best,â€ he said.

â€œAnd therefore, I want to play a role to help Singapore adapt as the world changes very rapidly, given digitisation and the onset of the impact of new technology.â€

Since 2013, Mr Goh has ben volunteering as a district councillor with the South West Community Development Council and also serves on the board of HomeTeamNS.

Mr Goh, who is vice-chairman of the Gambas-Yishun Citizensâ€™ Consultative Committee, has been seen with Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam at community engagements in Nee Soon, where he is expected to be fielded.

DR TAN SEE LENG, 55, former Parkway Holdings group chief executive

Dr Tan, who has spent more than 30 years in the medical sector, is the oldest PAP candidate introduced so far. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post on Thursday that he was glad that Mr Goh had found in Dr Tan a successor as branch chairman.

Dr Tan said he had spent two years under Mr Gohâ€™s tutelage and worked with him on a caregiver support network for the elderly that will be launched after the election, but declined to comment on where he will be fielded.

The father of three grew up in a Toa Payoh rental flat and is a family physician by training.

He said the deaths of his parents from cancer in the 2000s had strengthened his resolve to get a masterâ€™s in family medicine, followed by a Master of Business Administration.

Currently a corporate adviser to Temasek Holdings and adviser to DBS Bank, he is also an independent director of Surbana Jurong and was the former group chief executive officer and managing director of healthcare group IHH Healthcare Berhad.

TAN KIAT HOW, 43, former IMDA chief executive

Mr Tan, a public servant for nearly 20 years, was part of the team that set up the Pioneer Generation Officeâ€“ now known as the Silver Generation Office â€“ and was responsible for mobilising 3,000 volunteers to do outreach to nearly half a million seniors.

He took up the top post at IMDA in 2017. Under his leadership, the organisation took steps to build up Singaporeâ€™s connectivity infrastructure, such as the rollout of the countryâ€™s fourth telco.

Previously, he was deputy secretary for cyber and technology at the Ministry of Communications and Information, where he worked on Singaporeâ€™s national cyber security strategy.

Digitalisation is an issue close to his heart, he said.

â€œHelping workers, businesses to use technology to create more opportunities and for a better life is making sure that no one is left behind in a digital future.â€

â€œI see the importance of long-term holistic care, as our population ages rapidly, to consider both the social and health aspects to the well-being of our elderly,â€ said Ms Ng, who is married with one child.

During the Covid-19 outbreak, she said she helped bring in tele-health systems for community care facilities like the Singapore Expo.

â€œWe were working Monday to Sunday, there were no boundaries of work days to tackle the problem because it was 24/7,â€ she said, adding that she mobilised volunteers to help with Bengali and Tamil translations for infected migrant workers.

â€œIt was really all hands on deck...Covid-19 is still with us, and Iâ€™ll continue to be part of the fight against the virus.â€

ZHULKARNAIN ABDUL RAHIM, 39, lawyer

Mr Zhulkarnain, a partner at law firm Dentons Rodyk and Davidson, spoke of the need to build on community modes of distribution, such as neighbour networks to support the needy, and to â€œentrench this idea of humannessâ€ in policy-making.

Over the last decade, the father of three has conducted free legal clinics and done pro bono work as an assigned solicitor with the Legal Aid Bureau. He was previously the chairman of the Association of Muslim Professionals.

He was the fifth of six children. His mother was a housewife and his father did odd blue-collar jobs when they were growing up, eventually joining a construction company and working his way up to the rank of supervisor.

â€œFrom him, I remember the importance of lifelong learning,â€ said Mr Zhulkarnain, who would go through his fatherâ€™s presentation slides with him as his father did not know how to use PowerPoint.

â€œThe Covid-19 circuit breaker period has shown up various digital inequalities amongst our people, such as those who cannot afford digital devices to do home-based learning,â€ he said.

â€œBut what I feel is that beyond digital connectivity, it is human connectivity that we would have to look at in terms of policymaking and process.â€",0.31687622254288916,0.07599494949494949,Positive

With this round of introductions, the PAP has in all unveiled 27 new faces for the upcoming polls. Previously it had said it would present 26 new candidates.

Mr Chan said Ms Chan Hui Yuh is not exactly new, as she assisted the PAP in Aljunied GRC at the 2015 general election, but they had decided to include her as she is running for election for the first time.

Here's a look at the candidates' profiles:

DESMOND TAN KOK MING, 50

Former People's Association head



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



For Mr Desmond Tan, securing a government scholarship in his teens was the only way he could afford his university education.

But such social mobility among children from low-income families has become ""quite challenging"" in recent years, he said yesterday. It is a cause the father of three plans to champion if he gets elected.

Mr Tan grew up in a three-room Bukit Ho Swee flat that at one time housed 12 people - his own family of six, his uncle's family of four, his grandmother, and another uncle.

His father was a taxi driver, while his mother took on various jobs to supplement the family's income. These included working in a factory, as a babysitter, and selling satay and nasi lemak on the streets.

Mr Tan, a former Queenstown Secondary Technical School student, later went to Raffles Junior College. He was awarded the Singapore Armed Forces Merit Scholarship and graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1994 with first class honours in aeronautical engineering.

Mr Tan rose to the rank of brigadier-general before leaving to helm the People's Association in January 2017. There, he introduced Residents' Networks and Youth Networks to encourage social mixing.

EDWARD CHIA BING HUI, 36

Co-founder and managing director of Timbre Group



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) transform and ride out the Covid-19 crisis is one of Mr Edward Chia's top priorities if he is elected to Parliament.

His own business, the Timbre Group, runs food and beverage venues including Timbre+ and Yishun Park Hawker Centre, and has had to grapple with the impact of Covid-19 and deal with other common challenges SMEs deal with - coping with high rentals, insufficient manpower, and staying ahead of digital disruption.

""I go through this on a daily basis,"" he said. ""I can truly empathise with SMEs and I hope to be an effective voice for SMEs in Parliament.""

Mr Chia, the father of a six-year-old boy, is expected to be fielded in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC. He went to National Junior College and studied economics and political science at the National University of Singapore. He started Timbre at 21 when he was an undergraduate.

Said Mr Chia: ""We must redouble our efforts to support our SMEs - not just to survive, but to emerge stronger. In essence, stronger SMEs mean better jobs for Singaporeans.""

NADIA AHMAD SAMDIN, 30

Associate director at TSMP Law Corporation



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin's life has revolved around giving back to the community since she was 15 years old. She started her volunteer work with the South East Community Development Council, and moved on to focus on causes that help vulnerable women and children.

The lawyer, who is married and has no children, recounted how she once received a call from a child she was mentoring. The girl, whose parents were in prison, needed to go to school for a test. However, there was no money in her ez-link card. The incident prompted Ms Nadia to set up the Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud Top-up Fund, to make sure such children have enough money for transport.

The youngest among the new faces that will be unveiled by the PAP, Ms Nadia went to Victoria Junior College and read law at the Singapore Management University.

Apart from her community work, she also serves as a panel adviser for the Youth Court, where her role is to advise judges on the appropriate orders to pass in cases involving children and young persons.

The recreational diver has also seen first-hand the havoc wrought by climate change on the natural environment and hopes to champion this cause.

DON WEE BOON HONG, 43

Senior vice-president at UOB



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Mr Wee grew up in a rental flat and made the cut to enter junior college after finishing his O levels at Nan Hua High School. However, money was tight, so he decided to enrol in a diploma programme at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, so that he could start work early and help his family with the bills.

After completing his national service, Mr Wee joined a local bank as a non-executive staff member, and got an accounting degree after some years of part-time study.

He later qualified as a chartered accountant.

He has been a grassroots leader in West Coast for 16 years, and also speaks Hokkien and Cantonese.

Mr Wee, who has two children, is a member of the Institute of Mental Health's Visitors' Board. He said he hopes to help the less privileged, as well as those with mental health problems. He also hopes to help small and medium-sized enterprises.

Said Mr Wee: ""I hope that... politics can be an extension of my volunteerism, and a platform for me to raise residents' concerns and needs to policymakers.""

MOHD FAHMI ALIMAN, 48

Former Islamic Religious Council of Singapore deputy chief executive



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman is a former army colonel who stepped down as deputy chief executive of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) in March. He helped to form and steer the MÂ³@Bedok initiative, launched last year to help the Malay/Muslim community in Bedok Town.

The father of four joined the National Trades Union Congress' Administration and Research Unit in April, and has been spotted on the ground in Marine Parade group representation constituency.

Before he was appointed to his post in Muis, he spent 26 years in the Singapore Armed Forces. His military career included a six-month deployment to Blangpidie for the Aceh Monitoring Mission in 2005, where he was the deputy team leader.

His late father was a gas checker, while his late mother was a cleaner. When he was in primary school, he would help her clear rubbish, he said. She later upgraded her skills to become a cook in a factory.

That is why, said Mr Fahmi, the welfare of low-wage workers in essential services is close to his heart.

YIP HON WENG, 43

Former group chief of the Silver Generation Office under the Agency for Integrated Care



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Mr Yip received the Public Service Commission Overseas Specialist Award and started his civil service career as a physical education and mathematics teacher.

He later served in the education, manpower and defence ministries. He said he plans to help to improve aged care services in Singapore.

One incident he remembered vividly from when he first started out as a teacher, he said, was when he disciplined a student who repeatedly failed to hand in his homework.

He later found out that the student came from a poor family, and had to work part time after school. That is why he did not have the time or energy to focus on his school work.

This incident taught him the value of empathy, said Mr Yip, who is married with five children.

""That day, I learnt that it is very important to always ask and seek to understand the situation before we come to any conclusions about how others behave... This is how I will also continue to listen to the concerns of residents.""

HANY SOH HUI BIN, 33

Director at MSC Law Corporation



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Ms Soh, who was in the Normal (Academic) stream at Bendemeer Secondary School, later obtained a diploma in law and management from a polytechnic, and worked as a paralegal before saving enough money to pursue a law degree overseas.

She recounted how her secondary school teacher advised her that if she became a lawyer some day, she should serve ""the lost, the least and the last"".

This, she said, became her ethos in life and inspired her to get involved in grassroots work. For the last nine years, she has volunteered in Bukit Panjang, helping outgoing Bukit Panjang MP Teo Ho Pin.

Ms Soh, who has a 16-month-old daughter, co-chairs the Law Society's community legal clinics committee and set up the first community legal clinic in a residents' committee centre in the area.

She hopes to increase community awareness of legal issues, like the importance of lasting power of attorney, and make legal help more accessible, especially to those who are physically disabled. During the circuit breaker period, she was able to mobilise volunteer lawyers to conduct sessions over the phone or virtually.

DR TAN SEE LENG, 55

Former Parkway Holdings Group chief executive



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Dr Tan, who has spent more than 30 years in the medical sector, is the oldest PAP candidate introduced so far. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post on Thursday that he was glad that Mr Goh had found in Dr Tan a successor as branch chairman.

Dr Tan said he had spent two years under Mr Gohâ€™s tutelage and worked with him on a caregiver support network for the elderly that will be launched after the election, but declined to comment on where he will be fielded.

The father of three grew up in a Toa Payoh rental flat and is a family physician by training.

He said the deaths of his parents from cancer in the 2000s had strengthened his resolve to get a masterâ€™s in family medicine, followed by a Master of Business Administration.

Currently a corporate adviser to Temasek Holdings and adviser to DBS Bank, he is also an independent director of Surbana Jurong and was the former group chief executive officer and managing director of healthcare group IHH Healthcare Berhad.

TAN KIAT HOW, 43

Former IMDA chief executive

Mr Tan, a public servant for nearly 20 years, was part of the team that set up the Pioneer Generation Officeâ€“ now known as the Silver Generation Office â€“ and was responsible for mobilising 3,000 volunteers to do outreach to nearly half a million seniors.

He took up the top post at IMDA in 2017. Under his leadership, the organisation took steps to build up Singaporeâ€™s connectivity infrastructure, such as the rollout of the countryâ€™s fourth telco.

Previously, he was deputy secretary for cyber and technology at the Ministry of Communications and Information, where he worked on Singaporeâ€™s national cyber security strategy.

Digitalisation is an issue close to his heart, he said.

â€œHelping workers, businesses to use technology to create more opportunities and for a better life is making sure that no one is left behind in a digital future.â€

NG LING LING, 48

Former managing director of Community Chest

Ms Ng, who spent six years in banking before moving to social and public services, said she has been working on innovating new care models, such as using simple technology to help people with high blood pressure understand the disease and guard against strokes.

â€œI see the importance of long-term holistic care, as our population ages rapidly, to consider both the social and health aspects to the well-being of our elderly,â€ said Ms Ng, who is married with one child.

During the Covid-19 outbreak, she said she helped bring in tele-health systems for community care facilities like the Singapore Expo.

â€œWe were working Monday to Sunday, there were no boundaries of work days to tackle the problem because it was 24/7,â€ she said, adding that she mobilised volunteers to help with Bengali and Tamil translations for infected migrant workers.

â€œIt was really all hands on deck...Covid-19 is still with us, and Iâ€™ll continue to be part of the fight against the virus.â€

â€œBut what I feel is that beyond digital connectivity, it is human connectivity that we would have to look at in terms of policymaking and process.â€

MS YEO WAN LING, 44

Chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Ms Yeo was part of the global operations team at the EDB. She now runs Caregiver Asia, a social enterprise that connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers in Singapore. She said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly in Singapore to continue to work or contribute to the community.

Ms Yeo said one of the most meaningful things at EDB was â€œbeing able to work on projects that created and brought in very good and meaningful jobs for all Singaporeansâ€. She added that she started her social enterprise as she saw a gap in the provision of home-care services, in particular long-term care for the elderly.

On why she left the civil service to start her own venture, she said: â€œMy grandmother...was ill for a number of years before she passed on. And it was spending her twilight years together with me that I realised the importance of being able to grow old with grace and dignity.â€

Ms Yeo said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly to continue to work or contribute to the community, and wants to champion caregiving programmes.

Ms Yeo, who is married, said: â€œPolitics allows me to bring together the type of experiences I have with the civil service, and working in the community... and to be able to influence not just day-to-day operations of helping people, but also to bring it up to a larger platform such that I can (have an impact on) national policies.â€

MR ALVIN TAN SHENG HUI, 39

Head of Public Policy and Economics at LinkedIn



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Mr Tan has been a grassroots volunteer since 2005, working together with Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo in Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said he faced obstacles in his education journey â€“ he was once held back a grade, and did not do well enough to enter a local university.

Despite the earlier setbacks, he earned a Bachelor of Economics with First Class Honours from Sydney University, and later, a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University. He has worked at the Ministry of Defence, the United Nations and non-profit group Oxfam, as well as in investment banking. He is now in the technology sector - earlier at social media giant Facebook and now at social networking platform LinkedIn.

Mr Tan said he hopes to use his skills and experience in the public, private and non-profit sectors to help Singaporeans become more nimble and prepared for the future of work.

He said he also aims to bridge the digital divide for seniors and other vulnerable groups, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic has hastened the need for all Singaporeans to acquire such digital skills. Work is now being done to help these groups, and more needs to be done, he said.

Said Mr Tan: â€œBy the time Covid-19 is over... if we (still) havenâ€™t become comfortable with technology, I think we might have failed our people.

â€œAnd so I will continue to really tirelessly advocate, and go to the ground and help all our students, stallholders... prepare for the future of work that has come much sooner than any of us has expected.â€

DR WAN RIZAL WAN ZAKARIAH, 42

Senior lecturer at Republic Polytechnic

Dr Wan Rizal, who is married with four children, started volunteering in the community in 2010. He was chairman of Al-Islah mosque in Punggol, and was also part of Punggol's Interracial and Religious Confidence Circle.

He was a student in the Normal (Academic) stream before obtaining a polytechnic diploma and enrolling in the National Institute of Education and later Nanyang Technological University, where he obtained his degree in physical education at the age of 31.

He said: â€œI hope to be the voice in Parliament that upholds social mobility. Because of the non-linear path that I had taken, I strongly believe that education is the key to social mobility. This is how we can allow people who have less, or did less well to move up and prevent our society from being stratified.

â€œSingapore must continue to be a nation of opportunities for all, not for just the privileged few, or the lucky ones, but for every Singaporean.â€

Singaporeâ€™s education system is on the right track, he said. He added that he hopes to be part of its further development. For instance, he said he sees the value of early childhood education, and the importance of providing multiple pathways for Singaporeans to continue developing their skills.

He also hopes to advocate for the sandwiched class, as well as those who may face difficulties juggling work and family life.

MR ERIC CHUA SWEE LEONG, 41

Former director of the SGSecure programme

He was awarded the Local Merit Scholarship (Civil Defence) by the Public Service Commission to read communications studies at Nanyang Technological University. He served with the SCDF, eventually becoming commander of the 3rd SCDF Division.

Most recently, he was director of the SGSecure Programme Office in Ministry of Home Affairs.

Mr Chua, whose baby boy is eight days old, has spent 15 years doing community work with youth. He said he finds joy and satisfaction in mentoring young people and seeing them find success in life.

MR RAYMOND LYE HOONG YIP, 54

Managing partner at Union Law LLP



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Mr Lye, a father of three, has been volunteering for 25 years.

When introducing himself, he recounted how he and other volunteers helped a low-income resident deal with a problem.

Mr Lye, who chairs the Punggol East Citizensâ€™ Consultative Committee, said the residentâ€™s daughter had obtained a scholarship from an unnamed agency that allowed her to enter university despite her familyâ€™s finances.

But the agency later asked the resident to cough up a large sum of money as her daughterâ€™s grades were not good.

Mr Lye said that after several attempts, he and other volunteers managed to get the agency to write off the sum and the family was able to save up enough money to buy their own flat and move out of the rental block.

Despite having volunteered for groups like clan societies and trade associations, Mr Lye said that he finds community work most fulfilling. â€œMost satisfying for me is community work, where I get to listen to residents in their homes, their void decks and the coffee shops,â€ said Mr Lye, who has been volunteering in the new Sengkang GRC.

â€œI have always tried my best to help, as no government policy is foolproof and there are those who may fall through the cracks.â€

Sembawang is a special place for Ms Poh, a former helicopter pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the first woman to be appointed full-time aide-de-camp to the late President S R Nathan.

She spent a lot time in Sembawang when she was based at Sembawang Air Base for the RSAF.

And now that I have a chance to go back to Sembawang to serve on the ground, Iâ€™m really excited to work closely with our volunteers with our residents there,â€ said Ms Poh, who started volunteering in grassroots activities and Meet-the-People sessions in Sembawang GRC in 2018.

Ms Poh, who is single, started an annual Women Festival for the constituency and also took part in distributing food to rental flat residents.

Managing director and head of group audit at DBS Bank



PHOTO: PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY



Before taking up his position at DBS, Mr Goh headed its subsidary POSB, where he said he was exposed to volunteering efforts by community leaders and grassroots.

This inspired the father of three to take up community work.

Mr Goh spent more than 10 years at credit firm American Express, based in London and New York. He intends to use his experience from the international banking sector to help improve the lives of Singaporeans.

â€œI want to play a part to improve the system, to hone the system. And I know that Singapore is not perfect, but having lived in all these international financial centres, I can say personally that Singapore is the best,â€ he said.

â€œAnd therefore, I want to play a role to help Singapore adapt as the world changes very rapidly, given digitisation and the onset of the impact of new technology.â€

Since 2013, Mr Goh has ben volunteering as a district councillor with the South West Community Development Council and also serves on the board of HomeTeamNS.

Mr Goh, who is vice-chairman of the Gambas-Yishun Citizensâ€™ Consultative Committee, has been seen with Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam at community engagements in Nee Soon, where he is expected to be fielded.

She is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, where she has been active on the ground.

Ms Gan made history in 2015 when she became the first woman brigadier-general in Singapore. She resigned from her role as Chief of Staff - Air Staff in March.

She said she had served in the military for more than 25 years - ""one of the best choices and fulfilling choices that I made for myself"".

The armed forces, she said, is a place ""where men and women of different races, religions backgrounds, all come together, serving common goal to protect Singapore"". This desire to serve Singapore remained with her even after leaving the military.

The mission of the labour movement resonates with her, she said.

""I know the importance of bread and butter (issues) and the importance of having a job, to be able to protect one's lives, and their families"".

Asked about criticism that former military personnel are not qualified to be politicians, Ms Gan said she takes pride in her military experience, which has equipped her with leadership skills.

She added that in her military career, other than operations, she had been involved in long-term planning, capability development and policy work, manpower, intelligence, among others.

""I would say that I have gathered... several building blocks that I think are critical to any good organising entity and I would say the leadership experiences that I gained and also the lessons I learnt in taking care of people will help me to be a good politician.""

She appealed to the public to not rely on stereotypes. ""I hope that people will give me a chance - don't look at me as just another general - look at me for who I am.""

She started Trybe, a charity with Institute of Public Character (IPC) status, in 2001.

Trybe runs the Singapore Boys Hostel, Community Rehabilitation Centre for first-time drug abusers as well as Trybe Aftercare. It provides young people with guidance and offers support for their families and communities.

He stressed that such digital transformation cannot take place at the expense of others.

""For the seniors, for the low-wage workers, and for the less able - we have to make sure that they are part of this journey together. We will ensure that we leave no one behind.""

Mr Yeo, a lawyer, has chaired the party's Paya Lebar branch in opposition-held Aljunied GRC for more than three years.

He said he would like to help seniors and support less privileged families in Paya Lebar.

Another item on his to-do list is to address the challenges faced by parents of young children, who have to juggle between their work and family needs.

He said he fell in love with his wife, Priya, who is Hindu and South Asian, despite them being different culturally and having different religions ""because we share many similar Singaporean values and experiences"".

""We are thankful that Singapore is the home where children can be whoever they wish, and yet have a singular identity - that of being Singaporeans,"" said Mr Yeo, who is Catholic. He sees such values demonstrated in the community as well throughout his volunteering experiences.

""I hope to play my small part in contributing to continue to grow our inclusive society that we have worked so hard over so many years.""

Asked about the PAP team's chances at the upcoming election in wresting Aljunied GRC back from the Workers' Party, Mr Yeo said that while he is unable to speculate on the outcome, the team has been working hard on the ground for more than nine years to serve residents in the area.

Ms Mariam grew up in a one-room rental flat in Toa Payoh.

The daughter of a Malay teacher and a nurse, she said that while she had a happy childhood, there were moments when she knew things were not easy.

She would wake up in the middle of the night to find her father still working hard at the translation jobs he took on the side. Once, a burglar broke in and stole a whole month's salary that her father had just withdrawn from the ATM.

""Thanks to the sacrifices of my parents, the kindness shown by many and the quality of the Singapore education system, I've been able to go on to study at some of the best universities in the world and then work for some of the best companies in the world,"" she said.

Ms Mariam, who is Singapore managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group, has a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Master's in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

The vice-chairman of the Woodlands Community Club management committee is married with no children.

She said she is passionate about early childhood education, as she believes primary school is too late to start pushing for social mobility.

If she were to speak now to a young girl growing up in a rental flat like herself, she said, she would ask her to ""go out and be aggressive about what you want. Find your allies and your supporters"".

""Don't be afraid, don't limit yourself to thinking you can only take certain kinds of jobs. You can be a senior banker, you can be a law partner. We have it in this country to provide opportunities for everyone.""

In 2015, she moved to become an adviser to Aljunied Grassroots Organisations.

The mother of two, who works as a marketing director at Jingslink Marketing, hopes to speak up for low-income families.
