Mr Michael Chua, PSP's organising secretary and candidate in Tanjong Pagar GRC, said the party found it ""disturbing"" to have to submit its speeches 48 hours in advance and was worried that the contents might be leaked before the broadcasts.

However, the Elections Department (ELD) has responded saying that it has been standard practice since 1980.

The 55-year-old Mr Chua was speaking during a walkabout in Holland Village on Saturday (June 27) with his Tanjong Pagar GRC teammate Terence Soon and party member Lee Hsien Yang.

Besides the usual party political broadcasts for parties fielding at least six candidates, a new feature this general election is constituency-specific broadcasts, which will give candidates three minutes each to reach out to voters.

With physical rallies disallowed as a result of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 , these political broadcasts have taken on added significance.

The PSP, started just last year, is set to be the largest opposition contingent this time, fielding 24 candidates in nine constituencies, more than the 21 candidates that the Workersâ€™ Party plans to field.

Mr Chua told the media that PSP had concerns after being briefed about the procedure for the broadcasts by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) on Friday.

He said the party would have to submit the scripts in multiple languages to the IMDA and national broadcaster Mediacorp in advance, so that subtitles can be prepared.

""It is rather disconcerting to us because traditionally in a live rally, the candidates will present their ideas directly to the voters and the residents,"" said Mr Chua.

But this time round, the speeches have to be submitted to the authorities ahead of time, and ""potentially other people are also looking at whatever we submit"", he said.

""So what is the consequence of foreknowledge of whatever we are going to say? It's something that we find rather disturbing as a party,"" he added.

In response, the ELD said that the national broadcaster airing the party political broadcasts and constituency political broadcasts requires political parties and candidates to submit the scripts ahead of recording, to ensure that the contents do not contain libellous statements or statements that may cause racial or religious tensions or affect social cohesion.

â€œThis is not a new arrangement, and has been in place for the previous general elections since 1980. Political parties and candidates were also briefed on this on Friday, 26 June 2020,â€ said the ELD.

In addition to the PPBs and CPBs, political parties and candidates can carry out campaigning activities on the Internet, including via livestreaming.

â€œAs with the physical rallies of previous general elections, political parties and candidates are not required to submit their scripts for livestreaming to the authorities,â€ said the ELD, adding that political parties and candidates should conduct election campaigning in a responsible and dignified manner that befits the seriousness of the election process.

During the walkabout, Mr Lee, 62, the brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, remained coy on whether he would be contesting the general election for the PSP, saying instead that he was â€œguided by the party and Iâ€™m where they like me to help them (campaign)â€.

But party sources told The Straits Times that it is unlikely he will be running.

After Holland Village, Mr Lee headed to Bukit Merah where he joined another member of the PSP Tanjong Pagar GRC team, lawyer Wendy Low, for a walkabout."

But with three days until Nomination Day on June 30, party chief Tan Cheng Bock also told reporters during a virtual press conference that the line-up could still change. ""Let me remind you, in politics, change can happen. Candidates can be switched all around so you will have to just wait and see,"" said the 80-year-old former People's Action Party MP and 2011 presidential candidate.

One notable name was missing from the list, however - Mr Lee Hsien Yang.

The 62-year-old estranged brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was presented with his membership card during a public breakfast meeting in Tiong Bahru Market on Wednesday, leading to speculation that he could stand as a candidate in the July 10 polls.

The Straits Times understands, however, that Mr Lee is unlikely to be fielded.

PSP will be fielding the largest slate among the 11 opposition parties. Candidates will be fielded in the single-member constituencies (SMCs) of Marymount, Yio Chu Kang, Pioneer, Hong Kah North and Kebun Baru, as well as West Coast, Nee Soon, Chua Chu Kang and Tanjong Pagar GRCs.

WEST COAST GRC

Dr Tan, an MP for 26 years in single-seat Ayer Rajah, which was later absorbed into West Coast GRC in 2006, will lead the party's A-team in the five-seat constituency.

The other members include Ms Hazel Poa, 50, Mr Nadarajah Loganathan, 57, as well as two candidates who were introduced yesterday - party assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai, 60, who is the founder of a venture capital firm; and Mr Jeffrey Khoo Poh Tiong, 51, Asia-Pacific chief marketing officer for multinational insurance firm Ed.

TANJONG PAGAR GRC

In five-seat Tanjong Pagar GRC, the PSP will field lawyer Wendy Low, 43; technologist Harish Pillay, 60; PSP organising secretary Michael Chua, 55; senior trainer Abas Kasmani, 67; and new face Terence Soon, 29, a Singapore Airlines pilot.

NEE SOON GRC

Another candidate introduced yesterday - adult educator Kala Manickam, 52 - will contest the five-member Nee Soon GRC with IT project manager Taufik Supan, 40; media consultant Bradley Bowyer, 53; party treasurer Sri Nallakaruppan, 56; as well as customer service manager Damien Tay, 51.

CHUA CHU KANG GRC

The team in four-member Chua Chu Kang GRC will be led by former Republic of Singapore Air Force colonel Francis Yuen, 70; with academic Tan Meng Wah, 57; law undergraduate Choo Shaun Ming, 23; and fire safety engineer Abdul Rahman Mohamad, 67.

SINGLE SEATS

Meanwhile, psychiatrist Ang Yong Guan, 65; chartered accountant Kayla Low, 43; and former publisher of The Independent Singapore website Kumaran Pillai, 57; will stand in the newly formed SMCs of Marymount, Yio Chu Kang and Kebun Baru respectively.

Ms Gigene Wong, 54, who returned to Singapore early this year after 20 years in China, will contest in the SMC of Hong Kah North.

Finally, author and chartered financial consultant Lim Cher Hong, 42, who was also introduced yesterday, will stand in Pioneer.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock said: ""I am not fielding an Indian or a Chinese or an Englishman or a Malay. When you go to the polls, look at the person, not the colour (of his skin), not how big or how small he is... vote for them according to their ability, honesty, sincerity and willingness to serve.""

Mr Leong is the Progress Singapore Party's (PSP) assistant secretary-general and will be part of the team led by party chief Tan Cheng Bock contesting in West Coast GRC.

The son of a dried goods hawker, Mr Leong grew up in Chinatown and went to Raffles Institution.

He was awarded the Public Service Commission Overseas Merit scholarship and majored in economics at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, later completing a master's in management under the London Business School's Sloan Fellowship programme.

He was a director at Merill Lynch Hong Kong and a managing director at OCBC Securities before he founded his own investment firm.

Married with three adult children, the youngest of whom is a doctor on the front line of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Leong said: ""I want to do something more for the country so that everybody gets the same opportunity as me.""

Part of the Progress Singapore Party's five-man West Coast GRC team, Mr Khoo said his childhood ambition was to be a singer.

A National University of Singapore (NUS) graduate and a botanist by training, Mr Khoo held senior positions in the food and agribusiness sector and is honorary treasurer of the NUS Society.

Some of the policy changes he hopes to make, if elected, are: a review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between India and Singapore; a quota for Employment Pass holders; and ensuring there is knowledge transfer to Singaporean workers.

Married with three school-going children, Mr Khoo was already involved in grassroots work before joining the PSP. ""What affected me a lot was that at certain Meet-the-People Sessions, I saw people cry in front of me... It really made me think harder about what I need to do.""

Mr Lim graduated from the Singapore Institute of Management-University of London as the top business graduate in his cohort.

After a career in banking and insurance, he took a pay cut to work as a programme coordinator and trainer at the Silver Generation Office, where he managed volunteers who helped seniors apply for government schemes. ""To be honest, joining an opposition party was never my intention,"" said Mr Lim.

The father of three young boys, Mr Lim said more support needs to be given to parents with growing children and current schemes were inadequate to improve the total fertility rate.

He proposed more budgetary aid for young families, rent subsidies for couples waiting for their Build-To-Order flats and more family-friendly practices at the workplace.

KALA MANICKAM, 52

Adult educator

A single mother of an 11-year-old girl, Ms Manickam worked in the Singapore Armed Forces for seven years as a platoon commander and was in the first batch of women officers integrated into the tri-service, training alongside men.

She then left for the private sector where she has chalked up 30 years of experience in human resource management and learning development, of which 15 years have been spent as an adult educator.

She has a master's degree in lifelong learning.

Education is an issue close to her heart and Ms Manickam called for less administrative work for teachers, smaller class sizes and a more balanced education system.

""We have a lot of fantastic initiatives... But the way they are being executed is something we need to look into.""

She is part of PSP's five-member team that will contest in Nee Soon GRC.

TERENCE SOON, 29

Singapore Airlines pilot

The second-youngest candidate in the Progress Singapore Party's slate, Mr Soon is in the team contesting in Tanjong Pagar GRC. He said he was content handing out fliers when he joined the party, but becoming a father of a seven-week-old daughter pushed him to take the plunge into electoral politics.

""Many things started to click and as I started walking the ground - I realised that I am indeed called to be here because of what I believe in.""

Before joining Singapore Airlines as a pilot in late 2015, Mr Soon ran an aviation business which he started when he was 23 and was studying business management at RMIT University in Singapore. To develop the venture, he went to the United States on his own to build his own network of business contacts.

""People always say that I'm crazy. I do things normal people won't think of doing; firstly, starting a business at such a young age, then venturing overseas on my own and now, of course, joining politics,"" he said.

A member of the Progress Singapore Party's central executive committee, Mr Abdul Rahman was one of the 11 Singaporeans who founded the party along with Dr Tan Cheng Bock last year.

He started his career with the Singapore Fire Brigade in 1975 before becoming an engineer, and has seven children - four daughters and three sons - as well as two grandchildren.

In 2006, he was part of the Singapore Democratic Alliance team that contested in Tampines GRC and got 31.49 per cent of the vote.

After a stint working in Dubai, he returned home.

In the upcoming polls, he will be fielded in Chua Chu Kang GRC.

""During my walkabouts way back in 2006, I could see people were displaced. Now, I come back in 2020, and it is the same kind of situation,"" he said. ""The important thing is to narrow the income gap to give these people the opportunity to improve their lives.""

In an interview with Asia Times on the political situation in Malaysia, the 94-year-old was asked if he thought Malaysia would get a better deal if the People's Action Party (PAP) were voted out and the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) - which the Hong Kong-based online publication referred to as ""Prime Minister Lee's brother's party"" - were voted in.

Tun Dr Mahathir responded: ""Well, lah, we hope there is a change. But knowing Singapore, they are not very cooperative. They don't want to change anything. Everything is to their advantage, so they want to keep it that way.""

He added in the interview that was published yesterday: ""I do hope the brother, who has differences with his elder brother, would have a different attitude towards Malaysia.""

Mr Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, was unveiled as a PSP member on Wednesday, though it remains unclear if he would contest the election.

During both of Dr Mahathir's tenures as prime minister, from 1981 to 2003 and from 2018 to early this year, Singapore and Malaysia were involved in a series of bilateral disputes, including on the issues of water pricing as well as maritime and air boundaries.

He resigned as PM in February during a week of political turmoil which saw his Pakatan Harapan government collapse."

The ruling party's focus, said Mr Chan, is the same as it has been for many years - working closely with residents to continue solving their issues, taking care of them, and also collectively taking care of Singapore.

Mr Chan, who is the PAP second assistant secretary-general, said: ""For Tanjong Pagar, we welcome other people to come and stand. It offers Tanjong Pagar residents a choice. We are not particularly focused on who is coming or going.""

He was responding to a question on the prospect of Mr Lee Hsien Yang, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's estranged brother, contesting Tanjong Pagar GRC in the July 10 polls.

Mr Chan was speaking to reporters after wrapping up the last of the PAP candidate introductions in a virtual press conference at the party headquarters in New Upper Changi Road on Friday.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang has joined the opposition Progress Singapore Party (PSP), which announced his membership on Wednesday (June 24) at a breakfast meeting in Tiong Bahru Food Centre. The centre sits in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

However, he was not among the PSP's slate of 24 candidates, the last of whom were announced on Friday. PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock said his party's line-up will not be firmed up until Nomination Day on Tuesday (June 30).

Tanjong Pagar GRC is a PAP stronghold, and the bastion of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew - PM Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang's father. Mr Lee Kuan Yew held the Tanjong Pagar seat from 1955 - when it was a single seat - until his death in 2015, by which time it had become a part of Tanjong Pagar GRC.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling have been embroiled in a long-running feud with PM Lee over the fate of their father's house in Oxley Road.

When asked if he would be standing for election, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said: ""When I'm ready to disclose that, you will find out.""

On Friday, Mr Chan said: ""From the PAP team's perspective, we are focused on serving our residents day in, day out, and we have been doing that for the last many years.

""I'm sure Tanjong Pagar residents know us well, they know what we stand for, they know how we care for them. And I look forward to working closely with the residents to continue solving their issues, taking care of them, and also collectively taking care of Singapore."""

It was the third round of candidate introductions by the party and brings the total number of candidates it has made known so far to 17.

The party, led by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, has said it will be contesting 24 seats in nine constituencies in the coming general election.

The two former military men introduced are PSP organising secretary Michael Chua, 55, who has been spotted in party activities in Tanjong Pagar GRC, and Mr Nadarajah Loganathan, 57, the co-founder of a skills-training firm, who is expected to be on the party's A-team in West Coast GRC.

Mr Chua was an SAF Merit Scholarship recipient in 1985. He left active service in 2002 as a major and continued doing national service as a deputy brigade commander until 2016.

Mr Loganathan retired from the military in 2009 as a lieutenant-colonel.

The other three candidates introduced yesterday are: lawyer Wendy Low, 43, who is also believed to be in the Tanjong Pagar GRC team; customer service manager Damien Tay, 51, who has been seen on walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC; and Mr Kumaran Pillai, 57, former publisher of the website The Independent Singapore, who confirmed that he will be running in the newly carved out single-seat ward of Kebun Baru.

Dr Tan, 80, said during the press conference that the five are ordinary people who just want to serve the country, and who subscribe to his message that ""Singapore should change for the better"".

""They represent a spread of talent from all walks of life. Some may be more specialised, some may be just bringing their working experience to share with us, and also some of their involvement in NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and the private sector, and also some of them have worked before in the government sector,"" he said.

""They will bring along with them a lot of such experiences from all different sectors of our community and of our country.""

Asked about how age factored into his choice of candidates, given the five are all in their 40s and 50s, Dr Tan said that age was not a consideration.

FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE They represent a spread of talent from all walks of life. Some may be more specialised, some may be just bringing their working experience to share with us, and also some of their involvement in NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and the private sector, and also some of them have worked before in the government sector.

Runs a private firm in the environmental sector

Mr Chua is the organising secretary of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), and one of its 12 founding members. He has been involved in party activities in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

""I believe that I have no right to urge others to step forward, if I myself am not willing to take the plunge. I must have skin in the game. I must be at the forefront to share how we can do better.""

Mr Chua was a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Merit Scholarship recipient in 1985. He left active service in 2002 as a major and moved to the private sector, but continued doing national service as a deputy brigade commander until 2016.

""These experiences... shaped my thinking on how we can tackle the challenges the country faces, particularly the systemic problems that exist as a result of the structural deficiencies from an ever more rigid bureaucracy.""

NADARAJAH LOGANATHAN, 57

Co-founder of a skills-training firm

The former military officer is expected to be on the party's A-team in West Coast GRC.

Mr Loganathan served in the SAF for 25 years, retiring in February 2009 as a lieutenant-colonel. He went on to start a skills-training firm.

He said that he will focus on education policies and push for Singaporeans to be placed first in all job opportunities.

Mr Loganathan has been volunteering with the Hindu Endowment Board since 2016, leading a team of volunteers to manage the crowds during Thaipusam.

He was also actively involved in the Indian Activities and Educational Committee in Limbang Community Club from 2015, until he joined the PSP in January last year.

""I've settled my family. My three girls are all graduating or going to graduate very soon. And so I will look at how to then help the country,"" said Mr Loganathan.

KUMARAN PILLAI, 49

Runs a consultancy to develop start-ups

The former publisher of the website The Independent Singapore confirmed that he will be running in the new single-seat ward of Kebun Baru.

""I guess the cat is out of the bag for Kebun Baru. I've been walking the ground there. I've been doing my walkabouts at the Mayflower Market and in Sembawang Hills.""

Mr Kumaran left his post at the website in February this year after he entered politics.

He has been active in the start-up scene, running an incubator backed by Spring Singapore to launch about 28 local start-ups.

Mr Kumaran said an excessive focus on the economy has seen many in society left behind by government policies.

He said that after commenting and writing about politics for close to seven years, he was convinced by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, the party's secretary-general, that it is not enough and he needs to take the fight into Parliament.

WENDY LOW, 43

Lawyer

Ms Low was a partner at Rajah & Tann from 2008 to 2017, and currently leads the intellectual property advisory and dispute practice of Eldan Law LLP.

She has been spotted in party walkabouts in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

She has advocated for women's issues with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Hong Kong and Singapore, including in the Association of Women for Action and Research.

Ms Low has also been volunteering with Justice Without Borders, a cross-border NGO providing pro bono legal help to domestic workers in Singapore who have been abused or unfairly treated at work.

She said she has a passion for looking at issues of deep inequality, and wants to change the common mindset here that NGOs are ""just trying to be difficult"". Instead, Ms Low said they can drive long-term positive changes for people impacted by certain issues, and help the Government make better policies too.

She also hopes to preserve local art, culture and heritage, and leverage on technology to let women and freelancers gain meaningful home-based employment.

DAMIEN TAY, 51

Customer service manager

Mr Tay has three decades of commercial operations experience in multinational corporations in the electronics, retail and medical industries. He has been spotted in party walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC.

Currently a customer service manager, Mr Tay has three broad areas which he wishes to effect change in.

First, he wants better job opportunities for Singaporeans, in the light of the disproportionate number of foreigners in Singapore's workforce due to globalisation.

He also wants to bridge the inequality gap for a more equitable and proportionate distribution of wealth.

Mr Tay also wants to focus on addressing the impact of climate change here.

Ms Low was a partner at Rajah and Tan from 2008 to 2017, and currently leads the Intellectual Property advisory and dispute practice of Eldan Law LLP.

She has been spotted in party walkabouts in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

She has advocated for womenâ€™s issues with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Hong Kong and Singapore, including in the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware).

M Low has also been volunteering with Justice Without Borders, a cross-border NGO providing pro bono legal help to domestic workers in Singapore who have been abused or unfairly treated at work.

She said she has a passion for looking at issues of deep inequality, and wants to change the common mindset here that NGOs are â€œjust trying to be difficultâ€. Instead, Ms Low said they can drive long-term positive changes for people impacted by certain issues, and help the government make better policies too.

She also hopes to preserve local art, culture and heritage, and leverage on technology to let women and freelancers gain meaningful home-based employment.

Mr Tay has three decades of commercial operations experience in multinational corporations in the electronics, retail and medical industries. He has been spotted in party walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC.

Currently a customer service manager, Mr Tay has three broad areas which he wishes to effect change in.

Firstly, he wants better job opportunities for Singaporeans, in light of the disproportionate number of foreigners in Singaporeâ€™s workforce due to globalisation.

He also wants to bridge the inequality gap for a more equitable and proportionate distribution of wealth.

Mr Tay also wants to focus on addressing the impact of climate change here."

RP secretary-general Kenneth Jeyaretnam announced the decision at about 1.30am yesterday in a Facebook post, just hours after Parliament was dissolved and the Writ of Election issued.

The move likely leaves PSP to take on the incumbent PAP team in a head-to-head fight for West Coast.

On June 15, Mr Jeyaretnam unveiled six candidates, half of whom had been part of RP's 2015 team in West Coast, raising expectations of a three-cornered fight.

But yesterday, he said RP had been in ""long talks"" with PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock, and decided the ""greater cause"" at the moment was opposition unity and contesting where everyone has the greatest chance of winning seats.

""We also recognise that Dr Tan has a tough fight on his hands despite it being his old stomping ground and we do not wish to hinder his progress,"" he said.

Dr Tan thanked RP for not contesting West Coast.

""We all understand the implications of a three-cornered fight, so we are trying to put our differences aside so that we can contest with the PAP one on one,"" he told reporters yesterday morning.

The PAP defeated RP in West Coast in 2015 and 2011, and has won every election there since the constituency was formed in 1997.

But Dr Tan also often speaks of West Coast as his ""home"" ground.

It contains the former single seat Ayer Rajah, where he was the PAP's MP for 26 years until it was absorbed into the GRC in 2006.

Without revealing specific areas, Mr Jeyaretnam said PSP will withdraw from ""various grounds"" in return for West Coast. He said PSP also offered to cede Nee Soon GRC, but RP decided not to contest it.

Last night, a PSP spokesman confirmed that the party will still be contesting Nee Soon GRC, among nine constituencies announced by the party on Tuesday. When announcing the list of constituencies, Dr Tan had said it could still change.

""Of course, on Nomination Day, things change. Politics is very fluid, so we will study all these places more carefully,"" he said.

RP and PSP still have overlapping claims in Yio Chu Kang SMC. When asked if PSP might pull out to avoid a multi-cornered fight, the spokesman said that as of now, PSP still intends to contest Yio Chu Kang.

Party sources told The Straits Times that the candidate for Yio Chu Kang has already been decided, and is among the dozen unveiled by PSP so far.

Mr Jeyaretnam also said RP will contest in Radin Mas SMC and Ang Mo Kio GRC.

RP's decision to cede West Coast also prompted other concessions.

In a Facebook post at about 2.30am yesterday, the People's Power Party said it welcomed the RP's decision, adding that it ""will be most willing to take a step back"" and not field a candidate in Radin Mas, so that RP can focus on the ward.

Radin Mas contains the former Anson SMC - which was helmed by Mr Jeyaretnam's late father, veteran opposition leader and RP founder J. B. Jeyaretnam."

At a breakfast meeting at Tiong Bahru Market, Dr Tan presented Mr Lee Hsien Yang with a membership card.

Dr Tan said that Mr Lee has been a member ""for quite some time"", but due to the Covid-19 situation, they were unable to have a proper membership card presentation ceremony.

""This morning, I have great pleasure in giving this Progress Singapore Party membership card to Lee Hsien Yang, who joined us quite some time ago.""

Mr Lee turned up at 8.30am at the market with Dr Tan and a group of PSP members, all of them wearing the party's red-and-white polo T-shirt.

The Straits Times had reported earlier yesterday that Mr Lee had joined the party, but party sources said he was unlikely to be fielded as a candidate at the election.

Asked if he would be standing for election, Mr Lee replied: ""When I'm ready to disclose that, you will find out.""

On why he joined the party, he said: ""I joined the party because I think that Dr Tan is committed to doing the right thing for Singapore and Singaporeans and he loves the country. And he has brought together a group of people who share his vision, and it is a vision which I believe will build a better Singapore.""

Dr Tan was similarly coy about whether Mr Lee would contest the polls: ""I'm not confirming... Don't worry. In politics, we know when to make our move. Timing is important.""

He noted that there were many ways Mr Lee could contribute to the party: ""He is not just an ordinary person. His father is the founder of Singapore, you know, so that's very important. And the fact (that) he has decided to join us is a clear indication that the current (Government) didn't follow what his dad wanted.""

The market where Dr Tan and Mr Lee met is located within Tanjong Pagar GRC, a stronghold of his late father, Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. It is also one of nine constituencies the PSP has said it will be contesting in this election.

IT'S NOT TIME TO TELL I'm not confirming... Don't worry. In politics, we know when to make our move. Timing is important. DR TAN CHENG BOCK, on whether Mr Lee Hsien Yang would contest the polls.

Later in the evening, Mr Lee appeared in a brief online broadcast, appealing to Singaporeans to volunteer with the PSP and to donate generously.

He said: ""The PAP has lost its way. My sister Wei Ling shares this view too. In fact, she said so in a Facebook post in August 2016 before Oxleygate...

""It's possible to be loyal Singaporeans, to be proud of what has been accomplished in the past, to recite with pride 'we the citizens of Singapore', to love Singapore and yet to not vote PAP.""

He has been embroiled in a long-running feud with PM Lee over the fate of their father's house in Oxley Road.

Mr Lee's emergence comes a day after Parliament was dissolved and the Writ of Election was issued. Nomination Day is on June 30 and Polling Day on July 10.

Dr Tan said yesterday that he thought the timing of the election was ""irresponsible"" and potentially puts a lot of the elderly in a dangerous situation.

""The signs are there, it is so clear. And if they don't want to heed the signs, then the price they have to pay, as I said before, they might win this battle but they are going to lose the war.""

He has said on multiple occasions that he and Mr Lee Hsien Yang are good friends and that if Mr Lee wants to join PSP, it would have to be on the terms of the party.

The duo have been spotted before on several occasions having breakfast together, once at a hawker centre in the Prime Minister's ward.

In July last year, Mr Lee said on Facebook: ""I wholeheartedly support the principles and values of the Progress Singapore Party.""

PSP,https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/psp-set-to-field-24-candidates-in-nine-constituencies,2020-06-24 05:00:00+08:00,PSP set to field 24 candidates in nine constituencies,"The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) is set to contest nine constituencies in the general election, fielding 24 candidates instead of the 44 it announced initially.

The party had subsequently trimmed the list to 29, saying it was giving up some seats after discussions with other opposition parties to avoid three-cornered fights.

Yesterday, party chief Tan Cheng Bock, 80, disclosed during a Zoom meeting that the PSP intends to contest two five-member group representation constituencies - West Coast and Tanjong Pagar - the four-member Chua Chu Kang GRC, and five single-member constituencies: Hong Kah North, Pioneer and the newly formed Marymount, Yio Chu Kang and Kebun Baru seats.

While the former People's Action Party MP and 2011 presidential candidate did not mention five-member Nee Soon GRC, he said on Sunday during a walkabout in Chong Pang that the PSP was considering contesting the GRC. He said yesterday: ""We select the areas we want to contest based on whether we can win and there are certain places I'm quite familiar with... so we concentrate on the western side (of Singapore).

""Of course, on Nomination Day, things change. Politics is very fluid.""

Dr Tan also unveiled six more candidates for the July 10 polls, five of whom will be contesting their first election. The party introduced its first slate of six candidates last Thursday.

""My party is not a one-man party, it is not just a one-constituency party. The party will back every member,"" said Dr Tan.

The six new faces are:

â€¢ Mr Choo Shaun Ming, 23, a National University of Singapore law undergraduate who is the PSP's youngest candidate;

â€¢ Dr Tan Meng Wah, 57, a former Institute of Policy Studies research fellow, whose interests include income inequality;

â€¢ Mr Abas Kasmani, 67, a business consultant and senior trainer;

â€¢ Ms Kayla Low, 43, a chartered accountant and former prisons officer who volunteers with low-income families and the elderly;

â€¢ Mr Harish Pillay, 60, global head of community architecture and leadership at software firm Red Hat; and

â€¢ Dr Ang Yong Guan, 65, a psychiatrist who stood in the 2011 General Election as a Singapore Democratic Party candidate, and in the 2015 polls under Singaporeans First party where he was the chairman.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock did not indicate where the candidates will stand, but Mr Abas is one of two names tipped to take the final slot in the five-person West Coast team.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock was a PAP MP for 26 years, from 1980, in single-seat Ayer Rajah, which was absorbed into West Coast GRC in 2006. He is expected to lead the team there in the coming polls.

Meanwhile, Dr Ang was seen at Shunfu Mart Food Centre in Marymount SMC on Sunday and Dr Tan Meng Wah and Mr Choo were both present at PSP's walkabout in Teck Whye Lane, which is part of Chua Chu Kang GRC.

Dr Tan Meng Wah later put up an image on Facebook featuring himself, Mr Choo and two PSP central executive committee members: former air force colonel Francis Yuen, 70, and engineer Abdul Rahman Mohamad, who has yet to be formally unveiled as a candidate.

Mr Choo said he did not see his youth as a disadvantage.

Citing Scottish National Party MP Mhairi Black, who was elected at 20, and Emirati politician Shamma Al Mazrui who was made a Cabinet minister at 22, he said: ""Young people all over the world have shown that they can make a difference."""
