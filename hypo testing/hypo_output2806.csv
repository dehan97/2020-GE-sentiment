Asked yesterday if the party would follow the PAP in announcing its line-up before Nomination Day on Tuesday, Mr Singh said the WP would be sticking to the strategy it used in recent elections.

""Everybody has their own strategy that they bring to the table... Traditionally, the Workers' Party has always kept its cards close to its chest until Nomination Day,"" he said. ""And I think this is understandable. As a small player in the political scene, I think there are not many elements that we have in our favour, but one of them is actually surprise.""

He added: ""So, I would think that there will be no change to the plan to announce the candidates via the Nomination Day process. I think that will be the case unless something comes up before then.""

The WP has in the past sprung some last-minute surprises.

In 2011, it was not until the morning of Nomination Day, when then party chief Low Thia Khiang boarded the bus for the Aljunied GRC nomination centre, that it was confirmed he would leave his stronghold of Hougang to contest a group constituency.

WP is contesting 21 seats this year, and has revealed the identities of candidates in only Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC.

During a press conference where the party introduced new candidates, Mr Singh also spoke about how the party picks its candidates.

He was responding to a question about how the WP would react if their candidates found themselves in the same circumstances as PAP candidate Ivan Lim. Mr Lim had been criticised online by people who said they have had bad experiences with him in the past.

Mr Singh said all candidates fielded by his party are observed for a period as volunteers, and then as party members, before they are considered for elections. But he said there was no way to ensure they would not have skeletons in their closet.

""What we have to do in the circumstances is to make some decisions based on all the information that we have in our hands,"" he said. ""At times, we've also had to speak to the bosses of some of our candidates or their friends to have a better feel of a person, but, generally, I don't believe there's a fail-safe mechanism out there.""

A PROMISE This is my promise if elected: I will serve my constituents and the people of Singapore by speaking up for the powerless and speaking truth to power, and I will do this to the best of my abilities. NEW CANDIDATE MUHAMMAD FADLI MOHAMMED FAWZI, on having a soft spot for the underdog, and his concern for the powerless and marginalised in Singapore.

The WP introduced five candidates yesterday, three of whom are contesting their first election.

Mr Nathaniel Koh, 36, was a former member of the WP's youth wing and served as an election agent for the party in 2015 in the now-defunct Sengkang West SMC.

The IT professional, who works at security systems supplier Dormakaba Singapore, has been married for six years, and he and his wife are expecting their first child in September.

Mr Koh said he joined WP in 2009, when he was still a student at the Singapore Management University, as he believes that having diversity in Parliament is crucial to the long-term success of Singapore.

Asked what issues he would like to raise in Parliament, he said more needs to be done to encourage families to have children.

""It's not necessarily about monetary incentives like the baby bonus. We have to look at social incentives as well,"" he said, adding that policies must encourage both parents to care for their newborns and give them more time for childcare.

Ms Tan Chen Chen, 38, a contracts administrator and trained quantity surveyor, said she had volunteered with the party in the Bedok area after the previous election in 2015.

Speaking in Mandarin at the press conference, the mother of a three-month-old said property prices are an important issue today, especially to young Singaporeans.

Ms Tan added that the high prices may make it more difficult for today's young people to have enough for retirement later on as they may have to dip into their Central Provident Fund savings to pay for the flat. She said this is an issue she would like to raise in Parliament.

Lawyer Muhammad Fadli Mohammed Fawzi, 40, said he was concerned about the ""powerless and marginalised"" in Singapore, which he described as a country where power is concentrated in the hands of one party.

He said he ""always had a soft spot for the underdog"" and had attended opposition rallies since his youth.

He added: ""This is my promise if elected: I will serve my constituents and the people of Singapore by speaking up for the powerless and speaking truth to power, and I will do this to the best of my abilities.""

The other two candidates introduced yesterday had contested in the 2015 General Election.

Mr Kenneth Foo Seck Guan, 43, ran in Nee Soon GRC, and his team lost to the incumbent PAP, with 33.2 per cent of the vote.

The deputy director in a charity organisation has been a legislative assistant to party chair Sylvia Lim since the start of last year.

Mr Terence Tan, a lawyer and director at the firm Robertson Chambers, will turn 49 on Nomination Day. He contested Marine Parade GRC in 2015 and his team garnered 35.9 per cent of the vote.

He is the deputy organising secretary in the WP's central executive committee.

At the session, Mr Singh also said that the WP's manifesto will be released today, together with its final batch of candidates.

Mr Tan is a litigation lawyer who has been volunteering with the WP since 2011. He is married and has two sons.

In his electoral debut in 2015, the WP team in Marine Parade GRC garnered 35.9 per cent of the votes against the incumbent PAP team led by former prime minister Goh Chok Tong.

Mr Tan said yesterday that what he hopes to achieve in politics has not changed. ""I hope to ensure that the interests of Singaporeans are always placed at the very forefront of the Government's policies.

""Covid-19 has stress-tested the resilience of our economy and our savings. Singaporeans are understandably anxious for their families.""

Singapore faces ""many perils ahead"" and it needs a more diverse and inclusive Parliament with constructive and robust debates, he added.

""I appeal to Singaporeans to consider whether we should continue down the same path without at least appointing a few people to call out instances where the emperor may not wear clothes.""

In 2015, Mr Foo ran on the Workers' Party ticket in Nee Soon GRC. With 33.2 per cent of the vote, his team lost.

He became the party's deputy organising secretary in 2016, and served in that role until 2018.

Last year, he became a legislative assistant to Aljunied GRC MP and WP chairman Sylvia Lim.

In this capacity, he has been very busy over the past few weeks, as residents have been asking for help to apply for various grants and schemes to tide them over the Covid-19 period, he said yesterday.

He said: ""In the midst of Covid-19, we're calling an election. A lot of things must be going through the residents' minds: Why am I having an election at this time? But I'm not there to help them answer that.

""In fact, I'll put that question back to them to say it is a good question that you might need us to go into Parliament to help to ask.""

On the topic of transparency, he said that WP MPs have filed many parliamentary questions about key statistics that affect Singaporeans' lives.

""Some got answered. Some were half-answered. Some got no answer at all,"" said Mr Foo.

""I find this situation totally unacceptable, and we need to have a strong opposition presence in Parliament to hold the Government accountable for its actions.""

For the past five years, Mr Nathaniel Koh was the friendly face greeting those who turned up at the Meet-the-People sessions of Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh.

Yesterday, he was unveiled as one of the new faces the party will field this election.

Mr Koh, who was described as a ""GE veteran"" by WP party chairman Sylvia Lim yesterday, was an election agent and volunteer for the campaign of WP Sengkang West candidate Koh Choon Yong in 2011 and 2015.

Explaining why he decided to take the plunge as a candidate only now, after having been in the party since 2009, he said: ""I am standing in this election as a continuation of my journey to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, to help put Singapore on the clearer path to navigate the challenges ahead, and to make Singapore better than it is today.""

If elected, he said he hopes to champion the cause of young families.

Mr Koh, whose wife is expecting their first child, said he wanted to reduce the obstacles that young parents face in caring for their children by looking at social and not just financial incentives.

It was a soft spot for the underdog that got Mr Muhammad Fadli interested in opposition politics.

""We would always fight hard but always lose. But when we won, such as in Aljunied in 2011, it was something special. I guess I saw part of myself in that struggle - always having to fight harder and facing more difficulties to earn your place in the world,"" he said yesterday.

""But, to be honest, I would have it no other way.""

Having graduated from the National University of Singapore with a master's degree in sociology, Mr Muhammad Fadli worked for five years at the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. He went on to earn a Juris Doctor from the Singapore Management University.

Yesterday, he said: ""Many voters are sometimes afraid to vote for us, thinking that having more opposition will weaken the country. But this is exactly the opposite. When the Workers' Party speaks out, we are speaking out on behalf of Singaporeans who, for one reason or the other, feel that they are being left behind as the country moves forward.""

He added that with the WP in Parliament, the Government would be more responsive, and ""when we speak truth to power, we do so constructively because we believe that only by doing so can we make Singapore the inclusive and resilient country that each and every Singapore citizen deserves"".

Ms Tan Chen Chen may not have been a top student when she was in school, but she hopes that voters will give her a chance as she is ""willing to work hard and against the odds for what she wants"".

Since 2015, she has been volunteering at the Bedok Reservoir-Punggol ward of Aljunied GRC, helping out at the Meet-the-People sessions of former Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang.

Yesterday, as she was introduced as the WP's new face, she said in Mandarin: ""I hope there can be more (opposition MPs) in Parliament who will speak up on behalf of the people and help improve their lives, and not just oppose for the sake of opposing.""

She urged young Singaporeans to take an interest in politics, as it is necessary for them to chart their future.

The mother of a three-month-old child said the affordability of housing for young people is an issue close to her heart. She estimated that after buying a flat in a non-mature estate, a young couple will have to spend the next 30 years or so paying off the mortgage. ""By the time they reach 55, there will not be much left in their Central Provident Fund. How will we enjoy life? So housing prices will be my focus,"" she said.",0.42531691372600455,0.07356746578337486,Positive

""These have been very helpful to residents and I hope that we will continue to look at what else needs to be done. When I asked them if these have been adequate, many of them said 'yes', they can feel the flow of benefits,"" he added.

Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, was speaking to reporters after meeting hawkers and residents at Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre in West Coast GRC.

With him were two incumbent members of the People's Action Party (PAP) team, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har.

Mr Heng said his visit was meant to see if the Budget support measures have been working as intended, and if Singaporeans have further concerns. He was glad to hear many people, including stallholders and workers, tell him the financial support has helped.

""A job is the most important thing for our people, because once they have that, it's not just one-time support, but it is a continuous stream of income that you can look forward to,"" said Mr Heng.

""So I'm very glad to see that many of our companies are responding to this, and our workers are keeping their jobs.""

The four Budgets this year will see around $93 billion spent to help companies, workers and households cope with the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, and a key measure is the Jobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers by footing up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of local workers' wages.

Mr Heng also said others told him they were glad to have the Solidarity Payment - $600 in cash for all adult Singaporeans - and Solidarity Utilities Credit scheme, along with service and conservancy charges rebates and income relief for the self-employed. Public agencies are working hard to ensure the schemes reach their intended beneficiaries, he said, adding that the hawkers he met are glad that they get rental waivers for five months, and a range of support measures.

Residents are also coping, he said. ""People are adjusting very well to this new situation. Many of them have told me how they are supporting one another, and this is the neighbourly spirit that we need to develop in our society.""

Mr Heng noted that some companies which have done well during this Covid-19 period have rewarded workers with bonuses, saying more companies should do so.

While most of Singapore's economy has resumed since the second phase of reopening began last Friday, Mr Heng urged caution as the pandemic is still raging globally.

He later visited Causeway Point in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, accompanied by members of the PAP team there, Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad, and will be visiting constituencies islandwide in the coming days.

Meanwhile, asked about the challenge posed by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who is leading a team from the Progress Singapore Party to contest the five-member West Coast GRC, Mr Iswaran noted that other parties have contested the GRC in the past.

""Our message and stance have been consistent. We're focused on improving the lives and livelihoods of our residents. In other words, we want to take care of their needs, we want to enhance their well-being,"" he said.

The focus is on helping residents with immediate challenges posed by the Covid-19 situation, and also prepare for the long term, he said: ""That is our message to our residents, and that is the basis on which we will campaign, and we will stand on our track record.""",0.41785159285159285,0.19815462315462315,Positive

Mr Charles Chong, 67, Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the ruling party's longest-serving backbencher, is retiring after 32 years.

He won by the ""narrowest of margins"" in the last two elections not because he was a weak MP, but because he could be relied on to ""fight hard and fight smart"" in a tough contest, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday in tribute.

In 2011, Mr Chong won Joo Chiat SMC with 51.02 per cent of the votes against Mr Yee Jenn Jong of the Workers' Party (WP).

In 2015, he wrested Punggol East back from the WP's Lee Li Lian with 51.76 per cent of the votes.

""Always by the skin of his teeth... because when there is a tough fight, and we need a strong candidate who will fight hard and fight smart, we send in Charles Chong,"" PM Lee said. ""And every time, Charles has delivered.""

PM Lee also paid tribute to Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, whose retirements he had announced earlier.

""Boon Wan has been in all my Cabinets from day one, when I became PM; we have fought and won many battles together,"" he said.

PM Lee described their comradeship as ""exceptional"", adding that ""the warmth and mutual regard we have for each other has grown over many years as we worked together, dealing with the spikiest of problems"".

As for Mr Goh, PM Lee said he owed Singapore's second prime minister ""a huge debt of gratitude, because he was the one who brought me into politics, and has guided and mentored me all these years, even after I succeeded him as PM"".

With the PAP fielding 27 new faces, about 20 MPs will be retiring this year, said PM Lee.

Each of them has served Singapore and the PAP loyally, he said, and has agreed to step down as they understand the need for self-renewal and had put the party and nation before self.

Among those likely to step down are former office holders, Mr Lim Swee Say, 65; Mr Lim Hng Kiang, 66; Professor Yaacob Ibrahim, 64; and Mr Lee Yi Shyan, 58.

Backbenchers who are expected to quit politics include Bukit Panjang MP Teo Ho Pin, 60; Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo, 66; Pioneer MP Cedric Foo, 59; Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan, 57; and Marine Parade GRC MP Fatimah Lateef, 54.

Speaking later, Mr Chong said his 32 years in politics have been most meaningful.

Here is a summary of key points in the 10 areas it covers:

FACING THE CRISIS OF A LIFETIME TOGETHER

Singapore has weathered many crises - separation from Malaysia in 1965; British withdrawal in the 1970s; recession in the 1980s; Asian financial crisis in the 1990s; 9/11; Sars and the global financial crisis in the 2000s.

Covid-19 is the most dangerous public health and economic crisis in over a generation.

The PAP will work with Singaporeans to bring everyone safely through the storm. It has clear plans for Singapore's future beyond the crisis, and will invest in people, rebuild the economy and strengthen society.

STAYING SAFE AND HEALTHY TOGETHER

Healthcare professionals and front-line agencies will be equipped to provide excellent healthcare for all, with $20 billion allocated to the Ministry of Health in recent Budgets.

Covid-19 testing and tracing capabilities, and investments in R&D for treatment and vaccines will be ramped up. There will be access to protective items, such as masks for all, new norms of safe interaction and improved public hygiene.

There will be more migrant worker housing with improved standards. Health clearance of migrant workers will be completed so they can return safely to work.

CREATING JOBS AND ACQUIRING SKILLS TOGETHER

Jobs are a top priority. There are wage subsidies to protect workers from the immediate impact of Covid-19, income relief for the self-employed, financial assistance for retrenched workers.

No effort will be spared to protect and create jobs for Singaporeans. They will be equipped to take advantage of growth sectors and new opportunities through the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package.

Workers aged 40 to 60 will get extra SkillsFuture credits and subsidised reskilling programmes. Employers will get special incentives for hiring them.

Seniors, young job seekers, lower-wage workers and workers with disabilities will benefit from the Senior Employment Credit, re-employment grants and job redesigns, structured traineeships, enhanced Workfare support, extended Progressive Wage Model and Enabling Employment Credit.

TRANSFORMING AND GROWING THE ECONOMY TOGETHER

Businesses are receiving help to manage cash flow, costs and credit, with new laws on rental relief. Extra help is being given to hardest-hit sectors like aviation, hotels, tourism and retail.

Preparations for a post-Covid-19 economy include plans to speed up digital transformation, Transformation and Growth Packages, SMEs Go Digital grants and SkillsFuture Enterprise Credits.

There will be green lanes set up for safe travel with other countries, expanded trade networks to seek out new markets, and more diverse sources of food and essential supplies.

PROVIDING CARE AND SUPPORT TOGETHER

Families received help with expenses when the economy was shut down through cash payouts to parents and seniors, and utilities credits.

They will get continued help with costs of living through the Care and Support Package, enhanced housing grants, subsidies for transport, education and healthcare.

Related Story GE2020: Live coverage on Singapore General Election

There will be enhanced subsidies so pre-schools are as affordable as primary schools, with more places and higher quality.

There will also be more schools to cater to children with special education needs, and these will be more affordable.

There will also be more work and care options for such students beyond age 18.

Students from vulnerable backgrounds will get more support and guidance. Home-based learning will be made an integral part of education. Education reforms will be sped up, including more inter-disciplinary learning in higher education with lifelong learning in specialised areas.

Seniors will have more community-support networks, free entry to public gyms and pools, more financial security in retirement with the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme and enhanced Silver Support.

The polyclinic network will be expanded from 20 today to 32 by 2030.

To fund the healthcare needs of an ageing population, the goods and services tax (GST) will have to go up from 7 per cent to 9 per cent some time in the next term of government, but not before 2022.

To help Singaporeans cope with the GST hike, a $6 billion Assurance Package will pay for it for five years for most households and 10 years for lower-income households.

GST will continue to be absorbed by the Government on publicly subsidised healthcare and education, and there will be social assistance for those who need more help.

BUILDING A STRONG AND RESILIENT SOCIETY TOGETHER

The social compact will be strengthened through improved social safety nets, communities of care, digital inclusion and mental wellness.

There will be more support for social service agencies, through increased funding and matching of donations, as well as helping them transform their operations.

To boost financial resilience, almost $100 billion has been injected through four Budgets. The Government will continue to exercise financial prudence and replenish the reserves when it is able to do so to safeguard future generations.

LIVING SUSTAINABLY TOGETHER

Sustainability will be a way of life. Singapore will produce more clean energy by deploying more solar panels on building rooftops and reservoirs, reducing greenhouse emissions, and planting one million trees and new mangrove areas to preserve its carbon sinks.

There will be more nature in the city, with another 200ha of nature parks and 140ha of city parks and gardens over the next five years.

Singapore will face the storm of a century with unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude. The PAP will work with Singaporeans to seize new opportunities, reshape the future and build a sparkling city of tomorrow, emerging stronger from the crisis.

Coastal and inland flood protection against climate change and rising seas will be enhanced.

Local food production will be significantly scaled up, as will be long-term production capabilities for essential supplies.

BUILDING OUR CITY TOGETHER

Covid-19 will slow down, but not put an end to plans to develop Singapore - like the Tuas Megaport, Smart Nation and 5G network, Greater Southern Waterfront and Paya Lebar redevelopment, and rail networks.

CREATING A NEW FUTURE TOGETHER

Covid-19 has forced a global pause and reset. At this critical moment in human history, Singapore has a unique opportunity to reshape and redesign for the future.

The 4G leaders had earlier launched the Singapore Together movement for deeper partnership between the Government and Singaporeans to come up with plans for the country.

It will work with Singaporeans to chart a new direction for the country to emerge stronger as an economy, as a society and as a people.

OVERCOMING CRISIS TOGETHER

Singapore will face the storm of a century with unity, resilience, solidarity and fortitude. The PAP will work with Singaporeans to seize new opportunities, reshape the future and build a sparkling city of tomorrow, emerging stronger from the crisis.

This, and more, will be done ""because we have the Singapore spirit and each other"".

In a year marking the nation's Golden Jubilee celebrations, it spoke of a city of hope, heart, and home. It laid out plans and dreams of a brighter future that Singaporeans could build together.

Fast forward five years, and Covid-19 has decimated jobs, cratered economies, and ruined lives worldwide.

Amid the pandemic and the country's worst recession since Independence in 1965, the PAP's GE2020 manifesto, released yesterday, is markedly more sombre and urgent in tone than the last.

It seeks to focus Singaporeans' minds on three things: their lives, their jobs, and their future.

The message is clear: This is not the time to play a game of chance with lives and livelihoods; the PAP has the capability and resources to tackle Singaporeans' most pressing needs.

""Without a herculean effort by us, we cannot be certain that what we have painstakingly built over decades will continue to stand, and not collapse in the storm,"" warned Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the PAP's secretary-general, in a live online broadcast yesterday.

He said that in a normal election, the party's manifesto would focus on its long-term plans for Singapore. But given the pandemic, this year's central focus is ""how we will work together to overcome this crisis of a generation"".

In the foreword to the manifesto, he wrote that jobs are the top priority. ""We have mounted a national effort to keep people in work, to help those out of work find replacement jobs, and to create new jobs and traineeships both in the public and private sectors.""

A cornerstone of this effort is the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, which seeks to provide 100,000 jobs, traineeship and skills training opportunities to those affected by Covid-19. The Jobs Support Scheme, which subsidises wages, has also enabled firms to keep their workers.

The Government has committed $93 billion in Covid-19 support measures over four Budgets, drawing up to $52 billion from past reserves.

Noting that the party has steered Singapore through every major crisis since independence, PM Lee said it has clear and bold strategies to rebuild Singapore's economy, strengthen its society and plan for the country's future.

On this count, the manifesto leaves no stone unturned.

It is sweeping yet specific, describing both current steps and future plans in public health, the economy, urban rejuvenation, social welfare and the environment.

As PM Lee promised, jobs are front and centre of the agenda. Separate sections are devoted to different groups of workers: those aged 40 to 60, seniors, young job seekers, lower-wage workers and those with disabilities.

The support is differentiated - those in their 40s to 60s, for example, would benefit more from SkillsFuture credits and mid-career pathway programmes, while younger Singaporeans will have structured traineeships and regional opportunities.

Similarly, social policies and measures are carved out to meet specific needs of various groups - from families and students, to seniors and those with special education needs.

Acknowledging another looming challenge - Singapore's ageing population - the manifesto reiterates what party leaders have said, that to fund growing healthcare needs, the goods and services tax (GST) has to go up to 9 per cent some time in the next term of government, but not before 2022.

To help Singaporeans cope with the hike, there will be a $6 billion Assurance Package and an enhanced GST permanent voucher scheme.

The manifesto also sets out the PAP's longer-term plans to build a dynamic, resilient and responsive economy, ""no matter what happens"".

These include accelerating digital transformation across all sectors, promoting new growth sectors such as cyber security and healthcare, and diversifying the country's sources of food and essential supplies.

While the manifesto is distinctly different in tone and substance from the previous one, there are a few perennial themes: expanding the social safety net, equalising opportunities through jobs and education, providing greater assurance in healthcare and retirement, and leaving no Singaporean behind.

When it comes to transforming Singapore's physical and digital landscape, developments that have made headlines recently, such as Smart Nation, the Rail Corridor, Greater Southern Waterfront and Paya Lebar developments, were already set in motion in the manifesto five years ago.

Then, the PAP spoke of a shared purpose and involving Singaporeans in shaping policies - an idea that has evolved in the last five years to become the Singapore Together movement, now fronted by the 4G leadership.

This continuity is useful, as a party manifesto serves two functions: Internally, it sharpens the messaging used by individual candidates; and externally, it communicates a party's values and value proposition to voters.

Related Story GE2020: Live coverage on Singapore General Election

Exactly how it will be used in election campaign material remains to be seen. But to the voters, the party's message is simple: We are consistent, we have a plan, and we can deliver.

As PM Lee said, this is not business or politics as usual, and Singaporeans want to know how the Government will solve their problems.

The aim is not just to survive the storm, ""but also to maintain the long-term direction for the country, and keep on building and improving Singapore"".

""Hardly ever before has government been so crucial to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. This is why leadership is key, whom you choose to form the next government - and the quality of that leadership - is absolutely critical.""

He added that ""what the PAP promises, the PAP will deliver"".

Whether that message resonates with voters, and whether they will deliver yet another victory to the ruling party at the polls, will be revealed come July 10.

While the manifesto is distinctly different in tone and substance from the previous one, there are a few perennial themes: expanding the social safety net, equalising opportunities through jobs and education, providing greater assurance in healthcare and retirement, and leaving no Singaporean behind.",0.3320132386992853,0.05157366857948252,Positive

Its line-up of new candidates includes entrepreneurs, business people and social workers, as well as former civil servants and Singapore Armed Forces leaders. More than half are from the private and people sectors. One of the 27 new faces, Mr Ivan Lim, withdrew yesterday.

The remaining candidates range in age from 30 to 55, with the bulk in their late 30s and early 40s.

Ten women candidates make their election debuts this year, double the number in the polls of 2015.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the party's secretary-general, said he was proud that collectively, the new candidates represent a wide range of life experiences and backgrounds.

""This is what makes the PAP the mainstream party in Singapore - a broad tent that occupies the middle ground, and represents the vast majority of Singaporeans,"" he said yesterday.

The PAP typically retires one-quarter of its MPs at each election. It has fielded an average of 24 new candidates over the last five general elections, so this year's line-up of 27 newcomers is higher than average.

PM Lee highlighted the achievements of a few of them yesterday, during a live broadcast on Facebook and YouTube to announce the party's manifesto.

Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui, 36, co-founder and managing director of Timbre Group, grew a restaurant business into an entertainment and food and beverage enterprise popular with younger Singaporeans.

Mr Mohamed Sharael Mohd Taha, 39, who began his career building race cars, went on to handle global projects for Rolls-Royce. He is now on secondment to Singapore Aero Engine Services as vice-president for strategy and project management.

Several, PM Lee noted, have founded social enterprises and non-profit organisations.

Ms Carrie Tan, 38, is founding executive director of Daughters of Tomorrow, a charity that helps underprivileged women with livelihoods. Ms Yeo Wan Ling, 44, is chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia, which connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers.

Ms Rachel Ong, 47, helped start youth development charity Trybe.

""Beyond ability and performance, the new candidates, just like the older ones, also have a strong commitment to serving people,"" PM Lee said.

For some, their road to success was harder and less direct, he added.

A few grew up in rental flats, including Mr Don Wee Boon Hong and Ms Mariam Jaafar, both 43.

Mr Wee chose polytechnic over junior college so he could start work early and help support his family. Ms Mariam's family made sacrifices for her education; she went on to graduate with degrees from Stanford and Harvard universities.

Two candidates came up through the Normal (Academic) stream in secondary school.

Ms Hany Soh Hui Bin, 33, worked as a paralegal and saved up for a law degree overseas. Today, she is a lawyer and sets up legal clinics as a community service.

MANY PATHS TO SUCCESS The PAP has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore: Regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves. Our candidates know this is true - they have made it happen in their own lives, they have lived the Singapore story. PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG

Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 42, earned a diploma from Temasek Polytechnic, a degree in physical education at age 31, then a doctorate from Nanyang Technological University. He now teaches at Republic Polytechnic.

""The PAP,"" PM Lee said, ""has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore: Regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves.

""Our candidates know this is true - they have made it happen in their own lives, they have lived the Singapore story.""

The new PAP candidates will soon face the cut and thrust of electoral politics and find themselves ""out of their comfort zones"" but ""they will get used to it, and some may even, in time, relish it"", he said.

""If elected, they will become your representatives in Parliament because they are like you, they understand you and your concerns, and they care for you,"" he said.

""You can trust them to speak up on your behalf, and to work closely with you to find good solutions for you and for Singapore.""",0.35373376623376623,0.125850900307422,Positive

While the global pandemic may shape the contest at the polls, it also means the election will be devoid of the atmosphere of physical rallies, which will instead see party political broadcasts aired on national TV.

But the various political parties will still be selling party paraphernalia and merchandise.

Unlike previous years though, where merchandise could be bought at rally sites or party headquarters, restrictions on movements mean they can now be purchased only online - with a three-day wait for delivery.

The Workers' Party, for instance, has a dedicated e-store offering items such as umbrellas ($13 and $16), caps ($15) and tote bags ($20) in their signature sky blue colour.

Besides the usual staple of pins, flags and T-shirts, several parties are also banking on mascots.

The Singapore Democratic Party's (SDP) Danny the Democracy Bear mascot makes a return in soft toy form and three colours (yellow, pink or brown), retailing at $22.

The Progress Singapore Party (PSP) has Otica, the otter mascot, which has been making appearances at walkabouts.

Dubbed the party's ""Chief Compassion Officer"", Otica's name is an acronym for the party's core values of openness, transparency, independence, compassion and accountability.

In an Instagram story last Thursday, the PSP said that it is ""making plans for Otica to be available for public purchase"".

""However, no thanks to the Political Donations Act's rules, every time we sell one Otica, we have to collect all your particulars to ensure that you are Singaporean and fulfil all the criteria to donate - because purchasing Otica is considered a donation,"" the post said.

The law seeks to prevent foreigners from interfering in Singapore's domestic politics through funding of candidates and political associations, and requires receipts to be issued by recipients of cash donations, among other rules.

One of the more unique items available for sale is a $90 handmade clay figurine of Singapore People's Party (SPP) chairman Jose Raymond, who will be contesting the single seat of Potong Pasir.

A resident of the constituency gave him the idea, said Mr Raymond, 49.

""I thought it was a rather neat idea to have a mini figurine which people could keep as memory of the campaign we fought in the estate this year, especially since there is an interesting history behind why I am standing as a candidate in Potong Pasir SMC,"" he added.

He said that after his family lost their home in Jurong West in 1991, former SPP chief Chiam See Tong personally helped them by writing a cheque to the Housing Board to pay a deposit for a smaller flat, even though they were not residents of Potong Pasir.

Mr Chiam was then MP for Potong Pasir and the secretary-general of the SDP.

So far, five of the 25 figurines available have been sold, mostly to Potong Pasir residents. All money collected from the sales of merchandise will be ""used to help residents"".

As for the People's Action Party (PAP), a spokesman said: ""Our PAP branches may be distributing memorabilia at the branch level.

""The party and our candidates will adhere to the prevailing guidelines as laid out by the Multi-Ministry Task Force and Elections Department for any activities involving public interaction.""

Online marketplaces like Carousell and Shopee are stocking everything from inflatable yellow hammers in the style of WP's logo to PAP car decals. It remains to be seen if the face mask will make an appearance among the merchandise during this election period.

Asked if SPP has such plans, Mr Raymond said: ""There are no other plans for merchandising as we are now in the midst of the campaign proper.""",0.3577261904761905,0.05873809523809524,Positive

Workers' Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh said yesterday that the balance in Parliament remains a key issue at the election, even as Singapore confronts the Covid-19 crisis.

He added that the People's Action Party's call for a mandate to deal with the uncertainty did not lessen the need to elect a credible opposition for checks and balances on the ruling party.

Speaking at his party's candidate introduction press conference, he noted that the PAP will have a strong mandate even if the WP wins all the 21 seats it is contesting.

""The PAP is going to contest in 93 seats, the Workers' Party is contesting in 21 seats, and that leaves us potentially 72 seats in PAP's hands. I'm not sure whether that equates to a weak mandate. I think that's still a strong mandate for the PAP,"" he said.

""So what I believe Singaporeans should also consider is, as all of us collectively fight Covid-19, what about the balance in Parliament?""

The issue of the balance in Parliament has also featured in the campaigns of other opposition parties, with some urging voters to deny the PAP the two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to amend the Constitution.

With two days to go to Nomination Day, the opposition field has narrowed further, with the Democratic Progressive Party announcing that it would sit out the polls.

With the dissolution of the Singaporeans First party last week, there now remain 10 opposition parties that are set to contest the general election.

Two veteran opposition leaders announced plans to step back after the election if they are not successful. Singapore Democratic Alliance president Desmond Lim, 53, intends to hand over the reins of his party, while People's Power Party chief Goh Meng Seng, 50, said this would be his last election.

Yesterday was a busy day with several parties conducting walkabouts across Singapore.

They are Ms Poh Li San, Changi Airport Group's vice-president for Terminal 5 Planning, and Ms Mariam Jaafar, Singapore managing director and partner at the Boston Consulting Group.

The two new faces were featured in a video posted by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung on Saturday (June 27 ) that paid tribute to Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who is retiring from politics. Mr Khaw has anchored Sembawang GRC for 14 years.

In his post, Mr Ong said the Sembawang GRC slate was a five-man team when he joined in 2015.

""When the team was introduced publicly, Mr Khaw Boon Wan described it as the 'boy band'. Our lead singer has retired, and we have inducted two new lady candidates. We now look more like ABBA..+1,"" he said, referring to the Swedish pop group.

""We share the belief that Sembawang can be a very special place in Singapore, and must build upon the achievements of our predecessors,"" he wrote.

Ms Poh, 44, a former helicopter pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF), is set to replace Mr Khaw in his Sembawang ward.

Ms Mariam, 43, is likely to replace Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Health Amrin Amin in his Woodlands ward.

Mr Amrin is tipped to move to the new Sengkang GRC, to complete the four-man PAP slate that includes labour chief Ng Chee Meng, Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min and lawyer Raymond Lye.

The new line-up for Sembawang GRC would then comprise Mr Ong, Ms Poh, Ms Mariam, lawyer Vikram Nair and ophthalmologist Lim Wee Kiak.

They are set to face off against the National Solidarity Party (NSP), which contested the constituency in the 2015 election. NSP secretary-general Spencer Ng said he will be leading the party's Sembawang team.

In 2015, the PAP team won 72.28 per cent of the vote against the NSP team formed by Mr Ng, Mr Eugene Yeo, Ms Kevryn Lim, Mr Yadzeth Haris and Mr Abdul Rasheed.

Ms Poh and Ms Mariam were officially introduced by the party last week. The former is vice-chairman of the Sembawang Citizens' Consultative Committee, while the latter is vice-chairman of the Woodlands Community Club management committee.

Ms Poh believes women should have greater access to more opportunities and leadership roles at the workplace, especially in the emerging sectors and in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) industries.

Ms Mariam, who grew up in a one-room rental flat, said she hopes to help others and preserve the social mobility that she had enjoyed.",0.3792809042809043,0.11817780984447651,Positive

The PAP announced on Saturday (June 27) that Mr Lim had written to its secretary-general, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, earlier in the day to withdraw his candidacy.

Mr Lee has accepted his withdrawal.

The controversy surrounding Mr Lim, one of 27 new PAP candidates introduced last week, comes days before Nomination Day on Tuesday (June 30). It had caused concern among party activists that the issue would cloud the ruling party's campaign for the July 10 election.

In his letter to Mr Lee on Saturday, Mr Lim said further allegations emerged against him after he issued a clarification in response to initial allegations about his conduct at work and as a national service commander.

Mr Lim said the new allegations were ""baseless"".

""I recognise that the controversy over my candidacy has eclipsed the core issues of what this election should be about - Singapore's future and the difficult steps we have to take to recover from Covid-19,"" he wrote.

""The controversy has also caused intense pain and stress for my family. I cannot put my family through this,"" wrote the general manager (specialised vessels) at Keppel Offshore & Marine. He said he appreciated the support the party has given him in this period.

In his letter accepting Mr Lim's decision, Mr Lee said that the controversy about Mr Lim's candidature was unfortunate.

""Ideally, there would have been a fair and deliberate consideration of these allegations.

""Unfortunately, the nature of the campaign is such that we do not have time for a thorough investigation. The allegations spread like wildfire online, eclipsing the serious life and death issues we must grapple with,"" he wrote.

PM Lee said he respected Mr Lim's decision to withdraw, adding that he regretted the stress that Mr Lim and his family have had to bear during this period.

""I hope Singaporeans will give you and your family the peace and privacy to recover, and welcome your continued contribution to our society,"" added PM Lee.

Mr Lim, 42, who had been walking the ground in Jurong GRC and was expected to be fielded in the constituency, had earlier on Saturday responded to allegations of elitist behaviour and lack of humility in a statement through the party. He had said that he was ""determined to stay the course and to serve if I am elected"".

After Mr Lim was introduced as a candidate on Wednesday, several posts on social media accused him of elitist behaviour and of being arrogant as a national service commander, among other things. They were made by people who claimed to have known him during NS, in polytechnic, or at work.

However, several others who knew Mr Lim defended him in posts online. A video with three colleagues speaking about his character and qualities emerged on social media on Saturday.

Mr Lim responded to the allegations publicly for the first time in a statement issued by the party, saying: ""I accept that I can always do better and I am willing to learn. I will take this experience to heart and do my best to prove myself to voters and all Singaporeans.""

In his initial statement, Mr Lim said an allegation that he was involved in a bribery case concerning his company in Brazil was ""completely baseless and untrue"".

""I was not involved in any of the Brazilian projects,"" he said.

As for the stories about the army incidents, people can have different perspectives on the same incident, he added.

Mr Lim also said he set high standards for his military unit as a commanding officer, and that he did not ask soldiers to do something he was not prepared to do himself.

On criticisms from an ex-colleague, he said: ""The shipyard industry is a tough and exacting one and we have always required high standards of Keppel colleagues to ensure that they can return home safely to their families.""

As for another post on his not smiling to a neighbour in a lift, he said he did not recall a specific incident, adding: ""However, like many others who live in apartments, I know some neighbours better than others and interact with some more than others.""

Mr Lim's statement came shortly after Deputy Prime Minister and PAP first assistant secretary-general Heng Swee Keat said Saturday morning that Mr Lim should clarify the online criticisms.

Associate Professor Bilveer Singh of the National University of Singapore's (NUS) political science department said the PAP has prided itself on recruiting the best and brightest, but when such cases emerge, people will have deeper questions on the process.

He said of Mr Lim: ""If he withdraws, it will reflect badly on the PAP's judgment and selection process. But I think the backlash would be even greater, if he's kept.""

NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser said that while criticisms could be rationalised away, the court of public opinion may not be so easily convinced, if many already have a negative perception of him.

""The party leadership may have to weigh the odds of a fallout affecting the election outcome versus, say, a strong conviction that the candidate is a victim of a smear campaign and the party should therefore stand by its man, come what may.""

GE 2011 also saw a PAP candidate introduced who was eventually not fielded.

Unionist Steve Tan, then 37, dropped out on the eve of Nomination Day after allegations against him by former colleagues surfaced. He would have been fielded in Tampines GRC, but Mr Baey Yam Keng was moved there and orthopaedic surgeon Chia Shi-Lu, then 39, was fielded in Mr Baey's place in Tanjong Pagar GRC. Party leaders explained that Mr Chia was top of the party's reserve list.

Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, who was in charge of candidate recruitment, said then the PAP always catered to last-minute changes and had four reserves that year.

""It is not the first time that we have changed candidates at the last moment and it won't be the last,"" said Dr Ng then.

Prof Tan said the Ivan Lim incident could embolden others to use the same approach to call out candidates for public office in future.

""In the age of social media, any accusations could easily go viral, like a forest fire, and destroy the accused, unless the latter is able to do a quick comeback with a robust rebuttal, rather than let it simmer over several days,"" he added.",0.39348484848484844,0.11788518092315564,Positive

Mr Michael Chua, PSP's organising secretary and candidate in Tanjong Pagar GRC, said the party found it ""disturbing"" to have to submit its speeches 48 hours in advance and was worried that the contents might be leaked before the broadcasts.

However, the Elections Department (ELD) has responded saying that it has been standard practice since 1980.

The 55-year-old Mr Chua was speaking during a walkabout in Holland Village on Saturday (June 27) with his Tanjong Pagar GRC teammate Terence Soon and party member Lee Hsien Yang.

Besides the usual party political broadcasts for parties fielding at least six candidates, a new feature this general election is constituency-specific broadcasts, which will give candidates three minutes each to reach out to voters.

With physical rallies disallowed as a result of measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 , these political broadcasts have taken on added significance.

The PSP, started just last year, is set to be the largest opposition contingent this time, fielding 24 candidates in nine constituencies, more than the 21 candidates that the Workers’ Party plans to field.

Mr Chua told the media that PSP had concerns after being briefed about the procedure for the broadcasts by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) on Friday.

He said the party would have to submit the scripts in multiple languages to the IMDA and national broadcaster Mediacorp in advance, so that subtitles can be prepared.

""It is rather disconcerting to us because traditionally in a live rally, the candidates will present their ideas directly to the voters and the residents,"" said Mr Chua.

But this time round, the speeches have to be submitted to the authorities ahead of time, and ""potentially other people are also looking at whatever we submit"", he said.

""So what is the consequence of foreknowledge of whatever we are going to say? It's something that we find rather disturbing as a party,"" he added.

In response, the ELD said that the national broadcaster airing the party political broadcasts and constituency political broadcasts requires political parties and candidates to submit the scripts ahead of recording, to ensure that the contents do not contain libellous statements or statements that may cause racial or religious tensions or affect social cohesion.

“This is not a new arrangement, and has been in place for the previous general elections since 1980. Political parties and candidates were also briefed on this on Friday, 26 June 2020,” said the ELD.

In addition to the PPBs and CPBs, political parties and candidates can carry out campaigning activities on the Internet, including via livestreaming.

“As with the physical rallies of previous general elections, political parties and candidates are not required to submit their scripts for livestreaming to the authorities,” said the ELD, adding that political parties and candidates should conduct election campaigning in a responsible and dignified manner that befits the seriousness of the election process.

During the walkabout, Mr Lee, 62, the brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, remained coy on whether he would be contesting the general election for the PSP, saying instead that he was “guided by the party and I’m where they like me to help them (campaign)”.

But party sources told The Straits Times that it is unlikely he will be running.

After Holland Village, Mr Lee headed to Bukit Merah where he joined another member of the PSP Tanjong Pagar GRC team, lawyer Wendy Low, for a walkabout.",0.2893967143967143,-0.04026806526806526,Negative

Below is a summary of key points in the 10 areas it covers:

1. Facing the Crisis of a Lifetime Together

Singapore has weathered many crises - Separation from Malaysia in 1965; British withdrawal in the 1970s; recession in the 1980s; Asian Financial Crisis in the 1990s; Sept 11, Sars and Global Financial Crisis in the 2000s.

Covid-19 is the most dangerous public health and economic crisis in over a generation. The PAP will work with Singaporeans to bring everyone safely through the storm. It has clear plans for Singapore's future beyond the crisis, and will invest in people, rebuild the economy and strengthen society.

2. Staying Safe and Healthy Together

Healthcare professionals and front-line agencies equipped to provide excellent healthcare for all, with $20 billion allocated to Ministry of Health in recent budgets.

Ramped up Covid-19 testing and tracing capabilities, and investments in R&D for Covid-19 treatments and vaccines.

Access to protective items such as face masks for all, new norms of safe interaction and improved public hygiene.

More migrant worker housing with improved standards. Health clearance of migrant workers so they can return safely to work.

3. Creating Jobs and Acquiring Skills Together

Jobs are a top priority. Wage subsidies protect workers from the immediate impact of Covid-19, income relief for the self-employed, financial assistance for retrenched workers.

No effort spared to protect and create jobs for Singaporeans. They will be equipped to take advantage of growth sectors and new opportunities, through SGUnited Jobs and Skills package.

Workers aged 40 to 60 get extra SkillsFuture credits, subsidised reskilling programmes, special incentives for employers to hire them.

Seniors, young job seekers, lower-wage workers and workers with disabilities to benefit from Senior Employment Credit, re-employment grants and job redesign; structured traineeships; enhanced Workfare support and extended Progressive Wage Model; and Enabling Employment Credit, respectively.

4. Transforming and Growing the Economy Together

To stabilise them against the immediate effects of Covid-19, businesses get help with cash flow, costs and credit, new laws on rental relief, with extra help for the hardest hit sectors like aviation, hotels, tourism and retail.

Preparations for a post-Covid-19 economy include plans to speed up digital transformation, Transformation and Growth packages, SMEs Go Digital grants and SkillsFuture Enterprise Credits.

Green lanes set up for safe travel with other countries, expanded trade networks to seek out new markets, and more diverse sources of food and essential supplies.

5. Providing Care and Support Together

Families received help with expenses when the economy was shut down through cash payouts to parents and seniors, and utilities credits.

They will get continued help with cost of living, through the Care and Support Package, enhanced housing grants, subsidies for transport, education and healthcare.

Enhanced subsidies so pre-schools are as affordable as primary school, with more places and higher quality.

More schools to cater to children with special education needs; and more affordable. More work and care options for such students beyond age 18.

Students from vulnerable backgrounds to get more support and guidance. Home-based learning to be made an integral part of education. Education reforms to be sped up; more inter-disciplinary learning in higher education with life-long learning in specialised areas.

Seniors to have more community support networks, free entry to public gyms and pools, more financial security in retirement with Matched Retirement Savings Scheme and enhanced Silver Support.

Polyclinic network to be expanded from 20 today to 32 by 2030.

To fund the healthcare needs of an ageing population, the Goods and Services Tax must go up from 7 per cent to 9 per cent but not before 2022. To help Singaporeans cope with the GST hike, a $6 billion Assurance Package will pay for the GST increase for five years for most households and 10 years for lower-income households, with social assistance for those who need more help.

6. Building a Strong and Resilient Society Together

To strengthen the social compact, social safety nets will be improved, communities of care built with mental wellness as a key focus and greater digital inclusion.

More support for social service agencies, through increased funding and matching of donations, and help to transform their operations.

The Government will exercise financial prudence and replenish the reserves when it can, as a safeguard for future generations.

7. Living Sustainably Together

Sustainability will be a way of life, with more clean energy from solar panels on rooftops and reservoirs, reduced greenhouse emissions, planting of one million trees, new mangrove areas to preserve carbon sinks.

Another 200ha of nature parks, 140ha of city parks and gardens in the next five years.

Enhanced coastal and inland flood protection against climate change and rising seas.

Scaled-up local food production and long-term production capabilities for essential supplies.

8. Building Our City Together

Covid-19 will slow down but not put an end to plans such as Smart Nation, 5G network, Tuas Megaport, Greater Southern Waterfront, Paya Lebar redevelopment and doubling of rail networks.

9. Creating a New Future Together

Covid-19 has forced a global pause and reset. Singapore has a unique opportunity to redesign for the future.

The 4G leaders launched the Singapore Together movement for deeper partnership between the Government and Singaporeans, and will work with Singaporeans to chart a new direction for the country, to emerge stronger as an economy, society and people.

10. Overcoming Crisis Together

Speaking to the media during a walkabout at MacPherson Market and Food Centre, the 50-year-old said he had initially planned to stay in politics for 15 years or three election cycles.

But this will be his fourth, this time contesting the MacPherson SMC, where he is expected to face the People's Action Party's (PAP) Tin Pei Ling.

""When I first got involved in politics, I told my wife to give me 15 years. But now I might be crossing 20 years... My daughter, who wasn't even born then, has now grown up.

""I don't want to put my family through too much,"" added the opposition veteran, the principal consultant of market research and consultancy company Whiz Research and Consultancy.

Mr Goh made his debut as a candidate in 2006, when he contested Aljunied GRC with the Workers' Party.

""Every election, we lose money. I even sold my flat to finance the second one,"" he added, referring to the 2011 General Election where he contested Tampines GRC on the National Solidarity Party ticket.

Although he secured enough votes to get his election deposit back every time he contested, Mr Goh said there were other expenses such as the cost of setting up rallies, renting vehicles and producing posters.

In May 2015, months ahead of the general election that year, Mr Goh announced that he was setting up the PPP.

He then led a group of candidates that contested Chua Chu Kang GRC and lost to the PAP team helmed by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. PAP secured 76.89 per cent of the vote.

In a Facebook post on Saturday afternoon, Mr Goh provided his party's election manifesto.

It includes upgrading the older Housing Board flats in MacPherson through various programmes and schemes; setting up a community hospital to cater to the elderly; and inviting charities to set up free traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinics and soup kitchens.

Mr Goh called for a greater opposition presence in Parliament, even as he praised Ms Tin for her service to the residents in MacPherson.

He said: ""She's part of the (ruling) party so how do you expect her to be more critical of her own party's policies. So as an opposition member, and with an economics and statistics background, I think I can contribute more in Parliament for the nation.""",0.37277777777777776,0.1101010101010101,Positive

""These have been very helpful to residents and I hope that we will continue to look at what else needs to be done. When I ask them if these have been adequate, many of them have said yes, they can feel the flow of benefits,"" he added.

Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, was speaking to reporters after meeting hawkers and residents at Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre in West Coast GRC.

With him were two members of the People's Action Party (PAP) team, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har.

Mr Heng said his visit was meant to see if the Budget support measures have been working as intended, and if Singaporeans have further concerns.

He added that he was glad to hear many, including stallholders and workers, tell him the financial support has helped.

""A job is the most important thing for our people, because once they have that, it's not just one-time support, but it is a continuous stream of income that you can look forward to.

""So I'm very glad to see that many of our companies are responding to this, and our workers are keeping their jobs,"" said Mr Heng.

The Government's four Budgets this year will see around $93 billion spent to help companies, workers and households cope with the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, and a key measure is the Jobs Support Scheme to help companies retain workers by footing up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of local workers' wages.

Mr Heng also said others told him they were glad to have the Solidarity Payment - $600 in cash for all adult Singaporeans, paid out in April - and Solidarity Utilities Credit scheme, along with service and conservancy charges rebates and income relief scheme for the self-employed.

Public agencies are also working hard to ensure the schemes reach their intended beneficiaries, he said, adding the hawkers he met are glad that they get rental waivers for five months, and a range of support measures.

""People are adjusting very well to this new situation. Many of them have told me how they are supporting one another, and this is the neighbourly spirit that we need to develop in our society,"" he added.

Mr Heng noted that some companies which have done well during this Covid-19 period have rewarded workers with bonuses, saying more companies should do so.

While most of Singapore's economy has resumed since the second phase of reopening began last Friday (June 19), Mr Heng urged caution as the pandemic is still raging around the world, and second waves have emerged elsewhere.

He added that the last three Budgets were done in ""double quick time"", compared to the usual budget preparation period, which takes months.

""I'm glad that the mechanism that we have in place allows us to respond quickly, and I want to see the measures reaching the ground effectively. So I'm glad to see that this is happening,"" he said, adding that he would be visiting other parts of Singapore too.

Mr Heng later visited Causeway Point in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, accompanied by members of the PAP team there, National Development Minister and Second Finance Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister of State for Manpower and National Development Zaqy Mohamad.

Meanwhile, asked about the challenge posed by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, who is leading a team from the Progress Singapore Party to contest the five-member West Coast GRC, Mr Iswaran noted that other parties have contested the GRC in the past.

""Our message and stance have been consistent. We're focused on improving the lives and livelihoods of our residents. In other words, we want to take care of their needs, we want to enhance their well-being,"" he said.

Mr Iswaran added that the focus was on helping residents with immediate challenges posed by the Covid-19 situation, and also prepare for the long term.

""That is our focus, that is our message to our residents, and that is the basis on which we will campaign, and we will stand on our track record,"" he said.

The People's Action Party team won 78.57 per cent of the votes in the GRC in GE2015.

Mr Leon Khoo, 28, a stall-owner at Jurong West Hawker Centre selling handmade fries, said that while he has benefited from the five months worth of rental waivers, this measure would benefit hawkers in different places to different extents.

""For hawkers operating in hawker centres with higher human traffic, being allowed to take customers who are dining-in is more important as it forms a large proportion of their income,"" he said.",0.41235258993879687,0.18593073593073592,Positive

Speaking at the party's candidate introduction press conference, Mr Singh noted that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) will have a strong mandate even if the WP wins all the 21 seats it is contesting.

""The PAP are going to contest in 93 seats, the Workers Party is contesting in 21 seats, and that leaves us potentially 72 seats in PAP's hands. I'm not sure whether that equates to a weak mandate. I think that's still a strong mandate for the PAP,"" he said.

""So what I believe Singaporeans should also consider is, as all of us collectively fight Covid-19, what about the balance in Parliament?""

Mr Singh also responded to a question about how the WP would react if their candidates find themselves in the same circumstances as PAP candidate Ivan Lim, who has been criticised online by some who say they have had bad experiences with him in the past.

He said all candidates fielded by his party are observed for a period as volunteers and then as party members before they are considered for elections, but even then, there is no guarantee that they will not have skeletons in their closet.

Most WP members start out as volunteers before they become full members and this process allows the party leaders and senior party members to observe and make judgment calls about a person, before they decide if he or she is ""able to serve the public wholeheartedly"", Mr Singh added.

He said the party has on occasion also spoken to the employers and friends of potential candidates.

But he added that there is ""no fail-safe mechanism out there"" and what the party can do is to make decisions based on all the information it has.

The WP introduced five candidates on Saturday, three of whom are contesting in their first election.

Mr Nathaniel Koh, 36, was a former member of the WP's youth wing and served as an election agent for the party in 2015 in the now-defunct Sengkang West SMC.

The IT professional who works at security systems supplier Dormakaba Singapore has been married for six years and the couple is expecting their first child in September.

Mr Koh said he joined the WP in 2009, when he was still a student at the Singapore Management University as he believes having diversity in Parliament is crucial to the long-term success of Singapore.

Asked what issues he would like to raise in Parliament, he said more needs to be done to encourage families to have children.

""It's not necessarily about monetary incentives, like the baby bonus. We have to look at social incentives as well,"" he said, adding that policies must encourage both parents to care for their newborn babies and give them more time for childcare.

Mothers who want to re-enter the workforce after childbirth should also be encouraged and enabled to do so.

Ms Tan Chen Chen, 38, a contracts administrator and trained quantity surveyor, said she had been volunteering with the party in the Bedok area after the previous election in 2015.

Speaking in Mandarin throughout the press conference, the mother of a three-month-old said property prices are an important issue today, especially to young Singaporeans.

She said the prices of Housing Board flats have risen to the point that young people starting out with salaries of between $2,000 and $3,000 will find it difficult to afford a home.

Ms Tan added that the high prices may make it more difficult for today's young people to have enough to retire later on as they may have to dip into their CPF savings to pay for the flat, and that this is an issue she would like to raise in Parliament.

Lawyer Fadli Fawzi, 40, said he was concerned about the ""powerless and marginalised"" in Singapore, which he described as a country where power is concentrated in the hands of one party.

He said he ""always had a soft spot for the underdog"" and had attended opposition rallies since his youth.

""They would always fight hard but they would always lose. But when they won, such as in Aljunied in 2011, it was something special. I guess I saw part of myself in that struggle - always having to fight harder and facing more difficulties to earn your place in the world.""

He added: ""This is my promise if elected: I will serve my constituents and the people of Singapore by speaking out for the powerless and speaking truth to power, and I will do this to the best of my abilities,"" said Mr Fadli, who is also a town councillor at the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council.

The other two candidates introduced on Saturday had contested in the 2015 general election.

Mr Kenneth Foo Seck Guan, 43, ran in Nee Soon GRC and his team lost to the incumbent PAP, with 33.2 per cent of the vote.

The deputy director in a charity organisation has been a legislative assistant to party chair Sylvia Lim since the start of last year.

Mr Terrence Tan, a lawyer and director at the firm Robertson Chambers, will turn 49 on Nomination Day. He contested Marine Parade GRC in 2015 and his team garnered 35.9 per cent of the vote.

He is the deputy organising secretary in the WP's central executive committee.

At the session, Mr Singh also said that the WP's manifesto will be released on Sunday (June 28).

This is the third round of candidate introductions by the WP. A final round on Sunday will complete its slate of 21 candidates.",0.4748685922456414,0.06612802498048398,Positive

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is the party's secretary-general, also unveiled the PAP's campaign slogan for the upcoming election ""Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future"".

Here is his speech in full:

Party comrades, brothers and sisters of the NTUC, my fellow Singaporeans, good morning.

We are going into elections in the midst of a global crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic has affected many lives and livelihoods. After great effort, we have stabilised the situation in Singapore. Now we are resuming some activities and reopening our economy, cautiously, but our work is only just beginning.

The next government has a huge task ahead. It will have many important decisions to make, decisions that will affect our lives for years to come.

This is why I have called the general election now. It is to give Singapore a new government, a government with a full five-year term ahead of it and a fresh mandate from voters, a government which can focus on the urgent problems and deal decisively with them.

Today, the PAP is launching our manifesto for the general election. In a normal election, our manifesto would focus on all our long-term ideas to improve and transform Singapore - projects like the Tuas Megaport and Changi Terminal 5, development plans for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Jurong Lake District, more and better pre-schools, healthcare for the elderly, preparing for climate change.

All these plans are ambitious, but credible, because generation after generation, we have never stopped building on what we inherited in Singapore.

And also, because election after election, PAP governments have never failed to deliver on our promises to the people.

In normal elections, what is usually of much less interest to voters is the routine business of keeping Singapore going.

Singaporeans expect everything to continue running smoothly, and the PAP to continue to govern properly, before and after the election. They are confident the country will stay safe, our health services will continue to run, the economy will keep humming along, and jobs will always be available.

In other countries, this would be heroic, even reckless assumptions to make, but in Singapore, they are quite realistic, and have become the expectation and the norm.

But this time is different. This is not a normal election, and we are not in a normal situation.

We are in the middle of the most severe crisis in the world, that the world has faced for many decades. The immediate business of running Singapore is anything but routine.

Without a Herculean effort by us, we cannot be certain that what we have painstakingly built over decades will continue to stand, and not collapse in the storm.

Right now, keeping Singapore going, flying straight and level, safely through the turbulent weather is the most challenging and urgent priority for the Government.

Therefore, the central focus of this manifesto is how we will work together to overcome this crisis of a generation.

How we will keep Singaporeans and our migrant workers safe, and prevent Covid-19 from overwhelming our healthcare system and hospitals, how we will restart and transform the economy, save jobs and businesses, and reskill workers to take on new jobs, how we will provide care and support to one another, so that together we can keep ourselves all of us safe amidst the uncertainties and dangers.

These issues are at the top of people's minds.

Singaporeans understand that this is not business as usual, or politics as usual. You want to know how the Government will work with you to solve your pressing worries.

This manifesto - Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future - answers your questions.

Beyond Covid-19 and jobs, Singaporeans will also want to know what longer-term future you can look forward to. Where will Singapore be, in five, 10, 20 years' time?

After the crisis passes, can Singapore resume our journey, onward and upward?

So this manifesto also sets out the PAP's longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, because our aim is not just to survive the storm, but also to maintain the long-term direction for the country, and keep on building and improving Singapore.

This is the manifesto of a responsible party and government. Singaporeans can rely on the PAP government, both to address your immediate needs, and also to work with you to secure your long-term future.

What the PAP promises, the PAP will deliver.

To put this manifesto into action, we need the full support of Singaporeans.

We also need a strong, steady and capable leadership team - a team with experience who've been through previous crises, who know what to do, what resources are at your disposal, and what pitfalls and traps to watch out for, a team with young faces and new ideas who can look at old problems from fresh perspectives, and come up with better solutions, and a dedicated and committed team who have a heart for people and a willingness to listen and who are determined to serve and to do their best for Singapore.

Hardly ever before has government been so crucial to protecting lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. This is why leadership is key.

Whom you choose to form the next government and the quality of that leadership, is absolutely critical.

But even the best leadership team is only as strong as the support it gets. So we must fight hard to convince Singaporeans that our PAP team is their team, and deserves their full support.

In this general election, we have made an exceptional effort to put together such a national team.

We are fielding 27 new candidates this time - more than a quarter of our total slate, and more than in any previous election. They have all been introduced over the last few days.

But actually, most of them were already familiar to many residents, because they have been working on the ground for some time. Quite a few have been grassroots leaders and party activists for several years now.

We also have a good mix: entrepreneurs, businessmen and women, lawyers, social workers, public servants and SAF officers. And we have more women this time, 10 new candidates are female - double the last round - including our first female SAF general.

Individually, each of the new candidates brings something different to the team. They are each proven in their respective fields and professions.

One of them co-founded a restaurant business, which eventually expanded into an entertainment and F&B company especially popular with younger Singaporeans.

Another is currently vice-president at an aerospace company. He came back to Singapore to lead a major project, after many years working in the UK and Europe.

But beyond ability and performance, the new candidates, just like the older ones, also have a strong commitment to serving people.

Several have founded social enterprises and non-profit organisations.

We also have former civil servants who led the Pioneer Generation Office, which has now become the Silver Generation Office, and the People's Association.

Several of the candidates have taken harder roads to success. Two grew up in rental flats, another two came up through the Normal (Academic) stream and went on to polytechnic. One later earned a PhD and is now back in the polytechnic, teaching, nurturing the next generation. The other one worked as a paralegal before saving enough to pursue a law degree overseas. And now she's a lawyer, and continues to give back, setting up legal clinics in the community.

In fact, altogether five of the new candidates are polytechnic diploma graduates.

Having succeeded, they are now helping others to succeed too.

The PAP has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore.

Regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves.

Our candidates know this is true - they've made it happen in their own lives. They have lived the Singapore story.

I am proud of our candidates individually. But what I am most proud of is that collectively, the new candidates represent a wide range of life experiences and backgrounds.

This is what makes the PAP the mainstream party in Singapore - a broad tent that occupies the middle ground, and represents the vast majority of Singaporeans.

Our new candidates come from all walks of life, and they are representative of the complexion of our society. And if elected, they will become your representatives in Parliament.

Because they are like you, they understand you and your concerns, and they care for you.

You can trust them to speak up on your behalf, and to work closely with you to find good solutions for you and for Singapore.

Because of time, I am not able to speak in detail about all the new candidates one by one but we have made a short video so that you can put faces to the names, and know who all of them are.

Comrades, Brothers and Sisters, I present to you the new PAP candidates for GE2020.

The new candidates will soon face the cut and thrust of electoral politics. It will be a big step, probably a little out of their comfort zones. But they will get used to it, and some may even in time, relish it.

But in any election, the candidates with the most challenging task are the ones standing in opposition wards, in Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC.

In 2015, our candidates fought extremely hard and performed very well. In Hougang, Lee Hong Chuang improved the PAP's vote share to 42 per cent.

In Aljunied, Victor Lye's GRC team did well enough to demand a recount of the votes.

Ever since then, the PAP teams have been hard at work on the ground in Hougang and in Aljunied. Now they are ready to contest again, this time wiser, more experienced, and having formed deeper bonds with the residents.

I hope Hougang and Aljunied voters will give them a chance to show what they can do.

To our Hougang and Aljunied team, and to all our candidates wherever you will be standing: we support you fully, and we wish you all the best!

In every election as we field new candidates, so we also have MPs who are retiring. This year, about 20 MPs are retiring.

One of them is the Deputy Speaker, Charles Chong. Of all the PAP MPs, Charles probably has experienced the narrowest winning margins in elections. In 2011 he won in Joo Chiat with 51 per cent of the vote. In 2015, he took back Punggol East with 52 per cent of the vote.

Always by the skin of his teeth, not because he is a weak MP, but because when there is a tough fight, and we need a strong candidate who will fight hard and fight smart, we send in Charles Chong. And every time, Charles has delivered.

Khaw Boon Wan is retiring too. I published my valedictory letter to him yesterday.

But what makes Boon Wan special is not something that can be easily put down in any letter. Boon Wan has been in all my Cabinets from day one when I became PM. We have fought and won many battles together.

The warmth and mutual regard we have for each other has grown over many years as we worked together, dealing with the spikiest of problems. Ours is an exceptional comradeship that one is sometimes privileged to experience when we commit ourselves to public service.

What I say of Boon Wan applies even more to ESM Goh Chok Tong. ESM Goh too is retiring at this election.

This marks a major transition point for Singapore politics. ESM has served Singapore with great distinction, 44 years as an MP for Marine Parade, and 14 years as Prime Minister.

He has touched the lives of so many Singaporeans, and given his all in service of our country and people.

Personally, I owe ESM Goh a huge debt of gratitude, because he was the one who brought me into politics, and has guided and mentored me all these years, even after I succeeded him as PM.

I do not have time to thank all the retiring MPs one by one today. Each one has served Singapore and the Party loyally. And I have no doubt that if they were to contest the coming GE, many of them would put up a strong showing.

But they have agreed to step down, because they understand the need for self-renewal, and have put the party and nation before themselves.

So after the general election, we will create the appropriate occasion to properly express our deep appreciation to them.

Comrades, today we launch our party manifesto. On Tuesday, the general election campaign starts.

We're going into battle, to win the mandate of the people in a crucial contest.

Make no mistake - this will be a tough election. Singaporeans have lost jobs, families have suffered, many are hurting from the pandemic. We cannot take any vote for granted.

The Singaporean voter is a tough judge. We must fight hard for every single vote, in every single constituency - PAP or opposition, SMC or GRC.

But after winning the people's mandate, we will have a much bigger fight: To protect our people's lives and livelihoods during this deep crisis.

And beyond that, to fight year after year, to keep Singapore successful and special for this and future generations.

These battles can only be won if the PAP has the full support of Singaporeans, and Singapore has the strongest and most committed leadership team to take our nation forward.

Let us give it our all. Convince Singaporeans to give the PAP their strong support, and to work with us to secure our lives, our jobs, and our future.

West Coast GRC

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har were at Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre, interacting with members of the public.

During the walkabout, Mr Heng said the party's new face Ivan Lim should clarify the online criticisms he has received since being introduced on Wednesday.

""I have emphasised that integrity and character are very important in our candidates. And if there's any complaints, it should be properly clarified,"" he said. ""So I would like to see Ivan himself coming out to clarify this comment, so that we can hear both sides of the story.""

Members of the Progress Singapore Party, led by party chief Tan Cheng Bock, were at Block 726 West Coast Market Square, greeting residents. Dr Tan is expected to contest West Coast GRC.

Aljunied GRC

Mr Leon Perera, part of the Workers' Party line-up set to contest Aljunied GRC, greeted a resident at Block 538 Bedok North Street 3. The party held one of its first big market visits on Saturday, with nearly all party leaders present. WP chief Pritam Singh, chairman Sylvia Lim, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Faisal Manap - all candidates for Aljunied GRC - were also at the walkabout.

Mr Shamsul Kamar, a grassroots adviser in the GRC where he is expected to contest for the PAP, was distributing food rations to the elderly and shopping vouchers to needy residents at Kaki Bukit Community Centre.

In a Facebook post later on Saturday, he said regardless of who will be standing for the elections, “our commitment to help residents cope through this difficult period is paramount”.

“The work that will be cut out for us now is to secure Our Lives, Our Jobs And Our Future,” he wrote, citing the PAP’s campaign slogan for this election. But he said: “I was not on the ground to campaign for the elections this morning. Perhaps it was somebody else.”

Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC

The four-man Singapore People's Party (SPP) team for Bishan Toa-Payoh GRC led by party chief Steve Chia, 49, was accompanied by former party chairman Mrs Lina Chiam, 71, during a visit to the market at Block 127 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and nearby coffee shops on Saturday morning.

Mrs Chiam, who twice contested Potong Pasir SMC after her husband Mr Chiam See Tong, 85, left in 2011 to contest Bishan-Toa Payoh, told reporters that it was time for the couple to retire and spend their ""golden years"" together after more than four decades in political life.

""Mr Chiam is OK. He has got mobility issues but his heart is still with our party... He knows what is happening and he will be watching the news,"" she said.

On her decision to step away from electoral politics, she added: ""I don't have regrets. In politics, there are ups and downs.

""Our biggest happiness is that the party still goes on and there are people still following us.""

Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC

Singapore Democratic Alliance chairman Desmond Lim was out on a walkabout at Edgefield Walk in Punggol with party members and SDA candidates for the constituency. While the party faces a three-cornered fight there with the Peoples Voice party, SDA chief media officer Harminder Pal Singh told reporters that both sides are in discussions.

""We have been urging many different parties... to not have a three-cornered fight,"" he said, speaking to reporters on Saturday at the party walkabout in Punggol. ""Opposition unity is very important.""

Marine Parade GRC

Incumbent Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin had breakfast with PAP new face Mohd Fahmi Aliman at Haig Road Food Centre on Saturday morning. Mr Fahmi is tipped to replace Associate Professor Fatimah Lateef.

Dr Tan See Leng also had breakfast this morning in the constituency, at Marine Terrace. Dr Tan is expected to replace Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who on Thursday said he would be retiring as an MP after 44 years.

Later that day, Dr Tan distributed mosquito repellent and leaflets to residents of Blk 71 Marine Drive, to educate them about dengue prevention.

MacPherson SMC

People's Power Party chief Goh Meng Seng said during a walkabout in MacPherson that this would be his last contest in a general election.

""When I first got involved in politics, I told my wife to give me 15 years. But now, I've already crossed over 20 years. My daughter who wasn't even born then has now grown up. I don't want to put my family through too much,"" he said.

""Every election, we will lose money, I even sold my flat to finance the second one,"" he added, referring to the 2011 General Election where he contested Tampines GRC.

Mr Goh made his political debut when he contested Aljunied GRC with the Workers' Party in the 2006 General Election.

He was accompanied on his walkabout by members from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) including secretary-general Mohamad Hamim Aliyas, who confirmed that the DPP will not be contesting any constituency this election but will be supporting PPP and Mr Goh in his campaign for the MacPherson single seat.

Marsiling Yew-Tee GRC

After his morning at West Coast, Mr Heng also visited Causeway Point in Woodlands, with Minister of State for National Development and Manpower Zaqy Mohamad and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

The mall is in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, where Mr Wong is the incumbent anchor minister who will likely lead the PAP’s four-person team into the polls.

Mr Zaqy is expected to stand in the GRC, where he has been a grassroots adviser after Madam Halimah Yacob left in 2017 and was elected as the President. He is currently an incumbent for Chua Chu Kang GRC.

Hougang SMC

Mr Dennis Tan, WP candidate for Hougang SMC, was at a monthly food distribution drive in Hougang Ave 3 at about 2pm.

The initiative helps the lower income and needy families in the Hougang area, and the food is sponsored by a volunteer welfare organisation. Residents who were there for the distribution effort said Mr Tan and Hougang MP Png Eng Huat, who is stepping down, are a familiar sight at the drive.

Tanjong Pagar GRC

Mr Lee Hsien Yang, brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, was in Tanjong Pagar GRC. The younger Mr Lee was introduced as a PSP member this week, and was with Mr Terence Soon, the party’s candidate for the constituency.

They interacted with diners at Holland Village Food Centre and also went to HDB blocks in Holland Close on home visits, where they handed out fliers.

With the dissolution of the Singapore First (SingFirst) party, this means there are currently 10 opposition parties looking to contest the upcoming general election.

DPP will instead support the informal alliance with Reform Party (RP) and People's Power Party (PPP), the party said as it accompanied PPP secretary-general Goh Meng Seng on his walkabout at MacPherson Market and Food Centre.

Mr Goh is contesting the single-member constituency.

DPP secretary-general Mohamad Hamim Aliyas said the party will actively help these other parties in their campaigning.

Speaking to the media, the 57-year-old said: ""Right now the focus is on this general election and how we can still support each other like how we are showing support to Mr Goh...we have to be very collaborative in our political alliance.""

After earlier announcing its interest in the three wards, DPP held talks with the RP, PPP, and SingFirst, to discuss the possibility of avoiding three-cornered contests with Progress Singapore Party (PSP).

But nothing was concluded.

The Singapore People's Party (SPP) has since announced it plans to contest Bishan-Toa Payoh, while PSP plans to stand in the single-seat constituencies of Marymount and Kebun Baru.

Looking ahead, Mr Hamim, said that the DPP hopes to expand by recruiting more volunteers and continue working on the ground.

""After the election, hopefully our energy stays strong and we still have good health, we will go to the ground and meet the people and survey the constituencies and discuss how to make... things better for the residents,"" said Mr Hamim.",0.4619047619047618,0.15504201680672272,Positive

On Friday, PV secretary-general and founder Lim Tean said on Facebook that the party members, who were doing community outreach, were ""detained by police for over two hours"" with ""no charges, no legal reasons cited"".

He elaborated on the incident in a Facebook Live session later that day, saying that the party members were stopped by the police because they were holding up a ""montage of various PAP MPs sleeping in Parliament"".

Mr Lim also alleged: ""This is the sort of harassment that opposition members find themselves under all the time.""

In response to media queries, a police spokesman said on Saturday that it received a report about people displaying a placard at Pasir Ris bus interchange on Thursday at around 6.30pm.

At around 7pm, police officers located a group of three men standing together near Pasir Ris MRT station. One of them was carrying a PV flag and displaying a placard with a photo collage of politicians from another political party, said the police spokesman.

""The police officers established that they were using the placard to demonstrate against other politicians. They also had four other placards with the same photo collage in their possession,"" the spokesman added.

""Their actions thus amounted to a public demonstration, which requires a police permit.""

The spokesman added: ""Political parties and their members can, however, continue with their usual meet-and-greet sessions, which have been going on even before the Covid-19 crisis, subject to the prevailing safe distancing measures.""

Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC is one of the five constituencies that PV had earlier said it would be contesting. The others are Jalan Besar GRC and the single-seats of Pioneer, Mountbatten and Punggol West.

The police spokesman also disputed what Mr Lim alleged.

""Contrary to what has been alleged, the police officers did not inform them that there was no offence disclosed,"" he said.

He said: ""During the engagement, a member of the group claimed that he had a medical condition, and the police officers called for an ambulance.

On Saturday (June 27), the Elections Department (ELD) said in a statement that it had received 226 applications for the Political Donation Certificate by the Friday deadline.

This means there could be as many candidates for 93 seats in Parliament, although a number of parties typically apply for additional or standby certificates.

Singapore's election rules require all candidates to submit political donation forms, on which they have to record donations received and declare that the funds are permitted under the law, among other things.

This paperwork is needed to obtain political donation certificates, which the Registrar of Political Donations will issue by the eve of Nomination Day.

Candidates seeking election will have to submit these certificates with their nomination papers on Nomination Day next Tuesday. They must also have a proposer, seconder and at least four assenters, who must all be eligible to vote in the constituency.

There were 220 applications for such certificates in the last general election in 2015.

People's Action Party candidate Ivan Lim has announced he will not contest the general election. Read full story here

SINGAPORE - People's Action Party (PAP) candidate Ivan Lim on Saturday (June 27) addressed the criticisms levelled at him online, saying he is ""determined to stay the course and to serve"" if elected at the general election.

In a statement issued through the party, Mr Lim said: ""I accept that I can always do better and I am willing to learn. I will take this experience to heart and do my best to prove myself to voters and all Singaporeans.""

Criticisms from different quarters had surfaced online after the PAP introduced Mr Lim as one of its 27 new candidates to contest the July 10 general election on Wednesday, from people who claimed to have known him during national service or in polytechnic.

He was accused of elitist behaviour during a military exercise and of being arrogant, among other things.

In the statement, Mr Lim, 42, said it was important for him to state his position, as his family - in particular, his mother - was affected.

The general manager (specialised vessels) at Keppel Offshore & Marine said an allegation that he was involved in the company's bribery case in Brazil was ""completely baseless and untrue"", as he was not involved in any of Keppel's Brazilian projects.

As for the stories about the army incidents, people can have different perspectives of the same incident, he said.

""For example, it has been suggested in one of the posts that I was harsh for requiring the men to book-in at 2200 hours when the norm was 2359 hours,"" he noted.

""I should explain that on that occasion, the men had a move-out time early the next morning at 5am. It was important to ensure, and the rules required, that the men get enough rest. As such, I asked them to come back at 2200 hours and not 2359 hours,"" he added, noting that he came back earlier himself as well.

Mr Lim said he sets high standards for his military unit as a commanding officer, and believes in working together. He added that he did not ask the soldiers to do something he was not prepared to do himself.

On criticisms from a former colleague, he said: ""The shipyard industry is a tough and exacting one and we have always required high standards of Keppel colleagues to ensure that they can return home safely to their families. There are many colleagues who have been promoted and done well during my tenure as AGM and GM of Keppel.""

As for another post on how he did not smile at a neighbour in a lift, he said he did not recall a specific incident.

""However, like many others who live in apartments, I know some neighbours better than others and interact with some more than others,"" he added.

Mr Lim's statement came shortly after Deputy Prime Minister and PAP first assistant secretary-general Heng Swee Keat said on Saturday morning that he should clarify the online criticisms he has received.

Said Mr Lim: ""When I agreed to enter politics I expected that it would be tough. This test has come sooner than I expected.

Three incumbent Aljunied GRC MPs - party chief Pritam Singh, chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap - were joined by the two new members of the five-man slate during a walkabout at Block 538 Bedok North Street 3.

The two - Non-Constituency MP (NCMP) Leon Perera and former NCMP Gerald Giam - will replace former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwart Chen Show Mao, who will not be standing for election.

The party announced these changes during two online press briefings on Thursday and Friday, saying the moves are part of its leadership renewal process.

During the walkabout at a hawker centre and market, the WP members greeted residents and handed out WP fliers, had photographs taken with residents, and chatted with diners and stallholders.

Mr Singh was overheard telling a family who asked for a photograph that ""we must remember to keep 1m apart"".

Many residents greeted the WP members warmly - smiling and offering a thumbs-up as the politicians approached.

The WP team in Aljunied has been described by political observers as the party's ""A"" team.

Aljunied GRC is the only group representation constituency won by an opposition party.

On Saturday, Mr Singh thanked the media for adhering to the 1m safe distancing rules, saying: ""I know it's not easy, but the (safe distancing) ambassadors have a tough time, so let's try to help them out a bit.""

He declined to comment further, adding that the party will give more interviews in the days ahead.

Retiree Lin Siah Siong, 63, who has been living in the constituency for more than 30 years, said he will be casting his vote for the WP again.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said it was a pity Mr Low is stepping down.

He added: ""The candidates seemed sincere. They're not proud.""

SINGAPORE - The People's Action Party's first assistant secretary-general Heng Swee Keat says the party's new face Ivan Lim should clarify the online criticisms he has received since being introduced on Wednesday.

Mr Heng, who is Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, told reporters on Saturday (June 27): ""I have emphasised that integrity and character are very important in our candidates. And if there are any complaints, it should be properly clarified.

""So I would like to see Ivan himself coming out to clarify this comment, so that we can hear both sides of the story.""

Mr Heng was on a visit to Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre in West Coast GRC, along with Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har, both incumbent members of the PAP team in the constituency.

Mr Lim, 42, who is a general manager at Keppel Offshore & Marine, has recently been accused of elitist or arrogant behaviour by a number of people who claim to have known him at work or during national service.

However, others who know him have also come out in support of him online, and a video of several of his colleagues speaking up for him has been making the rounds on Saturday.

Mr Heng added that it was important to address the issue clearly, as all party candidates are expected to be able to address any concerns that may be raised about them.

""There are some of those who have put it on the Internet, they have also identified themselves - these are not anonymous points. And I would like to reach out to them to understand better what exactly had happened, so that we have a better understanding of the entire situation.""

He added: ""The key, as I mentioned, is whether the individual has the heart to serve all Singaporeans. And this is most important for us.""

The party on Friday (June 26) said its campaign slogan for GE2020 of ""Build Back Better, Fairer"" comes as the country faces an unprecedented global economic and health crisis, ""the likes of which we have never seen in our lifetimes"".

""This is a particular threat to Singapore's ability to continue to prosper, as we are already over-reliant on global trade and the Government's economic model of over-saving and running huge Budget and current account surpluses,"" RP posted on its Facebook page just before midnight.

The party said that it is not criticising government spending to protect Singaporeans' jobs and livelihoods, but believes that it is not enough.

It added that Singapore can spend an additional $60 billion every year from its reserves, which the party estimates to be at least $1.5 trillion. It did not elaborate on how it derived the number.

Among some of the RP's policy proposals include suspending the Goods and Services Tax for this year and the next, and a review to eliminate it on certain essential categories of spending, such as food, utilities and medicine.

It is also calling for an unemployment benefit of up to six months, based on 75 per cent of a person's last-drawn salary, capped at $2,500 a month.

Seniors aged above 65 would also receive $500 a month, while children whose families are at or below the 1.5 median income would receive $300 a month, under the party's proposal.

RP is also calling for universal healthcare, and free university education for those who have served national service.

Its proposal of a minimum wage of $10 per hour ""will ensure more jobs will go to Singaporeans and better wages for foreign workers"", it added.

The minimum salary for employment passes should also be raised to at least $5,000 a month, with a cap on the total number of passes given out, RP said.

Currently, the minimum qualifying salary for employment passes is $3,900 for new applications.

RP is also proposing additional tax for employment pass holders who have not done NS.

""These proposals will allow us to build a fairer and better society for all Singaporeans, not just an elite few,"" said RP.

The party had indicated on Wednesday that it will be contesting Ang Mo Kio GRC and the single-seat wards of Radin Mas and Yio Chu Kang, which may see RP in a three-cornered fight with the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) and People's Action Party.

On Thursday, RP chairman Andy Zhu said PSP had failed to honour its side of the agreement to withdraw from Yio Chu Kang, after RP pulled out of West Coast GRC.

And Singaporeans can trust them not only to represent their interests in Parliament, but also to work with citizens to find good solutions to Singapore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday (June 27).

In a live broadcast to deliver the PAP election manifesto, PM Lee said the ruling party is fielding 27 new candidates this time, more than a quarter of its total slate and more than in any previous election.

There are also 10 women being brought onboard this time, double the number in the last election in 2015, he added.

While they were introduced to the public in the last few days, most of them are already familiar to residents, having worked on the ground for years as grassroots leaders and party activists in some cases, said PM Lee, who is the PAP secretary-general.

The new faces, PM Lee said, are a ""good mix: entrepreneurs, businessmen and women, lawyers, social workers, public servants and SAF officers"", including the Singapore Armed Forces' (SAF) first female general, Ms Gan Siow Huang.

Each of them are proven in their respective fields and professions, he added.

Among those PM Lee highlighted were Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui, 36, the co-founder and managing director of Timbre Group, a restaurant business that grew to become an entertainment and food and beverage enterprise popular with younger Singaporeans.

He also touched on Mr Mohamed Sharael Mohd Taha, 39, who is vice-president for strategy and project management at Singapore Aero Engine Services.

Mr Sharael returned to Singapore to lead a major project, after spending many years working in Britain and Europe, PM Lee said.

""But beyond ability and performance, the new candidates, just like the older ones, also have a strong commitment to serving people,"" added PM Lee, noting that several of them have founded social enterprises and non-profit organisations.

These include Ms Carrie Tan, 38, founding executive director of charity Daughters of Tomorrow, and Ms Yeo Wan Ling, 44, chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia.

Several have also taken harder, less direct roads to success, said PM Lee.

These include two who grew up in rental flats - Mr Don Wee Boon Hong and Ms Mariam Jaafar, both 43 - and another two who went to the Normal (Academic) stream in school and went to polytechnic - Ms Hany Soh Hui Bin, 33, and Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 42.

PM Lee said: ""The PAP has made it a fundamental goal to open up many paths to success in Singapore: regardless of your family background, if you work hard, you can progress and make a good life for yourselves.

""Our candidates know this is true - they have made it happen in their own lives, they have lived the Singapore story.""

The new PAP candidates will soon face the cut and thrust of electoral politics, and it will be a big step for them, ""probably a little out of their comfort zone"", he said. ""They will get used to it, and some may even relish it.""

PM Lee said he was proud that, collectively, the new candidates represent a wide range of life experiences and backgrounds, and that is what makes the PAP ""the mainstream party of Singapore - a broad tent that occupies the middle ground, and represents the vast majority of Singaporeans"".

Setting out what is at stake as he launched the People's Action Party's campaign manifesto, PM Lee stressed that the immediate business of running Singapore is anything but routine.

""Without a herculean effort by us, we cannot be certain that what we have painstakingly built over decades will continue to stand, and not collapse in the storm,"" he said.

""Right now, keeping Singapore going, flying straight and level through turbulent weather is the most challenging and urgent priority for the Government.""

PM Lee, who is the PAP's secretary-general, noted that in a normal election, the party's manifesto would focus on its long-term plans for Singapore.

But given the pandemic, he said the central focus of the PAP's manifesto is ""how we will work together to overcome this crisis of a generation"".

He highlighted three issues on the top of voters’ minds: keeping Singaporeans and migrant workers safe from Covid-19 and keeping the disease from overwhelming the healthcare system; restarting and transforming the economy; and providing care and support to Singaporeans amid the uncertainty and dangers.

Said PM Lee: “Singaporeans understand that this is not business as usual, or politics as usual. You want to know how the Government will work with you to solve your pressing worries.”

The party’s manifesto for this election – “Our Lives, Our Jobs, Our Future” – answers those questions, he said.

Beyond Covid-19 and jobs, Singaporeans also want to know whether the country can continue its upward march after the crisis subsides, and where Singapore will be in 20 years’ time, he added.

“Therefore this manifesto also sets out the PAP’s longer-term plans to build a better Singapore, because our aim is not just to survive the storm but also to maintain the long-term direction for the country, and keep on building and improving Singapore,” he said.

He added that the manifesto was that of a responsible party and government.

“What the PAP promises, the PAP will deliver,” he said.

Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the manifesto launch was done over Facebook Live instead of at an event attended by party activists.

""Hardly ever before has government been so crucial to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Singaporeans. This is why leadership is key, whom you choose to form the next government - and the quality of that leadership - is absolutely critical,"" said PM Lee.

But he also said the team needed to work hard to convince Singaporeans that it deserved their support.

In 2015, the PAP's campaign slogan was ""With you, for you, for Singapore"".

With the manifesto launched, it is all systems go for the PAP, which completed introductions for its 27 new candidates on Friday.

The number of new candidates fielded this time to contest a total of 93 seats is higher than the party’s usual rate of one quarter renewal each GE.

The slate of new faces also comprises 11 women, more than double the five fielded in 2015.

PM Lee said the party’s new candidates have diverse backgrounds and can understand the concerns of all Singaporeans.

“Our new candidates come from all walks of life, and they are representative of the complexion of our society,” he said.

He also paid tribute to candidates contesting Workers’ Party-held constituencies of Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC, and called on voters to support them in the coming polls.

The prime minister thanked retiring MPs including political veterans Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and seven-term backbencher Charles Chong.

The party has about 20 MPs retiring this time, he said, as he thanked them for their contributions.

“They have agreed to step down, because they understand the need for self-renewal, and have put the party and nation before self. After the GE, we will create the appropriate occasion to properly express our deep appreciation to them.”

Before the election in 2015, he had set his sights on having Education Minister Ong Ye Kung succeed him as anchor minister in the group representation constituency.

Speaking to reporters at Canberra MRT station yesterday after his retirement from politics was announced, Mr Khaw, 67, said he has known Mr Ong since his civil service days at the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and described him as a ""very outstanding officer"".

""I was being selfish when I lobbied Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to get Mr Ong to come to Sembawang, so that I can hand over to him with confidence,"" he said. ""I'm quite sure that with Mr Ong, we made the right call.""

Yesterday, Mr Ong posted a tribute to his mentor on Facebook. He thanked Mr Khaw for including him in the Sembawang team and for the opportunity to lead negotiations on the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement signed in 2003 when he was a civil servant at MTI, describing it as a turning point in his career.

Yesterday, Mr Khaw teared up as he recounted Mr Ong's tribute. ""(It was) very kind of him to acknowledge the small role I played in his career. But that is the way we ought to behave as supervisors, or bosses, or managers - your job is to nurture the young.""

Mr Khaw tackled hot-button issues that emerged as flashpoints in past elections, from public transport to housing. On housing and transport, he said: ""Both were important, critical political problems. One was during GE2011, one was in GE2015. And if I could not deliver... I think the damage is to the party. So there was great pressure on our shoulders.""

His team, he said, ""dared not rest"" and continued to push on.

""Fortunately, with the support of many people... (we managed to) deliver,"" said Mr Khaw, who added he is glad rail reliability has not emerged as an issue in this election.

He made the announcement at a virtual press conference to introduce the last eight of 27 new faces that will contest the election.

Unveiled over three days, the newcomers are a varied lot: 15 come from the private sector, including such fields as law, banking and business, while the remaining 12 are drawn from the public service, the social and non-profit sector, and the military.

Asked if any of them are of ministerial calibre, Mr Chan said it is ""premature to do any such comparisons"".

""Even for the 2011 and 2015 batches, it is premature for us to try to claim credit or success,"" he added, referring to the new PAP faces in the last two elections.

In 2011, when Mr Chan was introduced along with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong and Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, they were called the ""Fantastic Five"" - touted to be the core of the fourth-generation leadership.

Yesterday, Mr Chan told reporters that while he was at the new Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) from 2012 to 2015, many had asked him if he thought he had done well enough as a minister or done enough for vulnerable families.

But such policy work, he said, is a long-term project.

""Many of the children whom we are helping will take 15 or 20 years to grow up. We will never really know whether we have done well until, perhaps, 15 or 20 years later.""

The same logic applies to other policies and issues, he added at the press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road.

""How we measure success is not whether they do well today or tomorrow only. It is whether they do well beyond the short term... And how do we collectively do well as a country.""

MEASURE OF SUCCESS How we measure success is not whether they do well today or tomorrow only. It is whether they do well beyond the short term... And how do we collectively do well as a country. PAP SECOND ASSISTANT SECRETARY-GENERAL CHAN CHUN SING, on policy work being a long-term project.

As electoral candidates, the mindset to adopt is, ""never be too anxious to claim success, but always be the first one to take responsibility to take Singapore forward"", he said.

Mr Chan was also asked about criticism that the PAP candidates have similar backgrounds, resulting in the possible danger of groupthink in the party.

He pointed out that the entire slate of 93 candidates, including incumbents, come from diverse backgrounds in varied sectors, including business, social service and the public service.

""We have covered the various sectors, but more importantly, beyond just where they come from... we should avoid pigeon-holing people just because of (their) profession.""

Every candidate, he said, has a unique personality, and Singaporeans will get a chance to know them better in the coming weeks.

On the lack of Indian candidates among the 27 newcomers, he said in the total slate of 93 candidates, there is an above-average representation of the Indian community.

There were nine Indian MPs from the PAP in the 13th Parliament, six of whom are office-holders, he noted.

This works out to 9.7 per cent of the total slate of PAP candidates, slightly higher than the ethnic composition in the population, as Indians made up 9 per cent of the resident population last year.

The need for all 93 candidates with different experiences to pull together as a team was reiterated by Mr Chan.

He said the PAP's leadership system is not one that involves pitting one batch of candidates against another.

""It is about different batches of people all coming together to serve with a common purpose.""

Continuity, consistency and coherence underlie its policies and they are not done by an individual or a single batch of people.

Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing yesterday paid tribute to former WP chief Low Thia Khiang, whose party on Thursday said he is stepping down from electoral politics.

Mr Low's successor Pritam Singh also thanked Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong yesterday. Mr Goh had said he would be retiring as an MP on Thursday after 44 years.

Mr Singh, in a Facebook post, wrote about a Parliament session in May 2018, when he went to take his newly allocated seat opposite the Government's front bench - the same seat Mr Low sat in when he was party chief.

When Mr Goh walked in, Mr Singh said he got up from his seat to shake the former prime minister's hand. He said Mr Goh's first words to him were: ""Congratulations on your demotion! Previously you were sitting higher up, now you have come down!""

In his post, Mr Singh said: ""I appreciated his good humour and it went some way that day to put things into perspective for me.""

Mr Singh added that in the Parliament member's lounge, on more than one occasion, Mr Goh shared his thoughts with him on, among other things, issues such as the Government's position on the country's reserves, and how race was employed ""cynically"" in past elections by some.

Said Mr Singh: ""I have my own views about many of these matters shared by ESM Goh. But I thought it said something of the man - the second prime minister of Singapore - to engage not just me, but my Workers' Party colleagues outside the Parliament chamber.""

More recently, Mr Goh would always ask about how Mr Low was doing after his fall whenever he saw Mr Singh in Parliament.

Mr Singh said: ""From all of us at the Workers' Party, thank you for your service to Singapore, ESM Goh.""

Mr Goh, in his own Facebook post yesterday afternoon, said that he had retired as an MP but not from politics. He said: ""My key focus ahead is to support and strengthen the 4G leadership team, and ensure a smooth transition.

""Keeping Singapore going is like pushing a boulder up a hill. You have to keep on pushing or the boulder will roll back down. The 4G leaders are taking over the pushing of the boulder. Singaporeans must avoid the fate of Sisyphus,"" said Mr Goh, referencing the figure from Greek mythology who was forced to roll a boulder up a hill only for it to roll down whenever it neared the top.

Mr Chan, during a press conference to unveil new PAP candidates yesterday, was asked how Mr Low's decision to step down would affect the tone of the general election and the PAP's deployments.

He said: ""We thank Mr Low for his many years of service to the Workers' Party, and also to Singapore. And we hope that all of us will work together as a system to take Singapore forward.""

Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin also thanked Mr Low for his service, as well as friendship, in a Facebook post yesterday. ""We may be from different political sides and hold opposing views about issues, but I do know that we actually share many things in common. For one, I know that your heart is with Singapore and Singaporeans,"" said Mr Tan.

He added that he deeply appreciated the various conversations and discussions the pair have had on different issues.

He said: ""I hope we stay in touch. Most importantly, I wish you good health and happiness.""",0.3621708892200698,0.12084161284980958,Positive

But with three days until Nomination Day on June 30, party chief Tan Cheng Bock also told reporters during a virtual press conference that the line-up could still change. ""Let me remind you, in politics, change can happen. Candidates can be switched all around so you will have to just wait and see,"" said the 80-year-old former People's Action Party MP and 2011 presidential candidate.

One notable name was missing from the list, however - Mr Lee Hsien Yang.

The 62-year-old estranged brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was presented with his membership card during a public breakfast meeting in Tiong Bahru Market on Wednesday, leading to speculation that he could stand as a candidate in the July 10 polls.

The Straits Times understands, however, that Mr Lee is unlikely to be fielded.

PSP will be fielding the largest slate among the 11 opposition parties. Candidates will be fielded in the single-member constituencies (SMCs) of Marymount, Yio Chu Kang, Pioneer, Hong Kah North and Kebun Baru, as well as West Coast, Nee Soon, Chua Chu Kang and Tanjong Pagar GRCs.

WEST COAST GRC

Dr Tan, an MP for 26 years in single-seat Ayer Rajah, which was later absorbed into West Coast GRC in 2006, will lead the party's A-team in the five-seat constituency.

The other members include Ms Hazel Poa, 50, Mr Nadarajah Loganathan, 57, as well as two candidates who were introduced yesterday - party assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai, 60, who is the founder of a venture capital firm; and Mr Jeffrey Khoo Poh Tiong, 51, Asia-Pacific chief marketing officer for multinational insurance firm Ed.

TANJONG PAGAR GRC

In five-seat Tanjong Pagar GRC, the PSP will field lawyer Wendy Low, 43; technologist Harish Pillay, 60; PSP organising secretary Michael Chua, 55; senior trainer Abas Kasmani, 67; and new face Terence Soon, 29, a Singapore Airlines pilot.

NEE SOON GRC

Another candidate introduced yesterday - adult educator Kala Manickam, 52 - will contest the five-member Nee Soon GRC with IT project manager Taufik Supan, 40; media consultant Bradley Bowyer, 53; party treasurer Sri Nallakaruppan, 56; as well as customer service manager Damien Tay, 51.

CHUA CHU KANG GRC

The team in four-member Chua Chu Kang GRC will be led by former Republic of Singapore Air Force colonel Francis Yuen, 70; with academic Tan Meng Wah, 57; law undergraduate Choo Shaun Ming, 23; and fire safety engineer Abdul Rahman Mohamad, 67.

SINGLE SEATS

Meanwhile, psychiatrist Ang Yong Guan, 65; chartered accountant Kayla Low, 43; and former publisher of The Independent Singapore website Kumaran Pillai, 57; will stand in the newly formed SMCs of Marymount, Yio Chu Kang and Kebun Baru respectively.

Ms Gigene Wong, 54, who returned to Singapore early this year after 20 years in China, will contest in the SMC of Hong Kah North.

Finally, author and chartered financial consultant Lim Cher Hong, 42, who was also introduced yesterday, will stand in Pioneer.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock said: ""I am not fielding an Indian or a Chinese or an Englishman or a Malay. When you go to the polls, look at the person, not the colour (of his skin), not how big or how small he is... vote for them according to their ability, honesty, sincerity and willingness to serve.""

Mr Leong is the Progress Singapore Party's (PSP) assistant secretary-general and will be part of the team led by party chief Tan Cheng Bock contesting in West Coast GRC.

The son of a dried goods hawker, Mr Leong grew up in Chinatown and went to Raffles Institution.

He was awarded the Public Service Commission Overseas Merit scholarship and majored in economics at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, later completing a master's in management under the London Business School's Sloan Fellowship programme.

He was a director at Merill Lynch Hong Kong and a managing director at OCBC Securities before he founded his own investment firm.

Married with three adult children, the youngest of whom is a doctor on the front line of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Leong said: ""I want to do something more for the country so that everybody gets the same opportunity as me.""

A National University of Singapore (NUS) graduate and a botanist by training, Mr Khoo held senior positions in the food and agribusiness sector and is honorary treasurer of the NUS Society.

Some of the policy changes he hopes to make, if elected, are: a review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between India and Singapore; a quota for Employment Pass holders; and ensuring there is knowledge transfer to Singaporean workers.

Married with three school-going children, Mr Khoo was already involved in grassroots work before joining the PSP. ""What affected me a lot was that at certain Meet-the-People Sessions, I saw people cry in front of me... It really made me think harder about what I need to do.""

Mr Lim graduated from the Singapore Institute of Management-University of London as the top business graduate in his cohort.

After a career in banking and insurance, he took a pay cut to work as a programme coordinator and trainer at the Silver Generation Office, where he managed volunteers who helped seniors apply for government schemes. ""To be honest, joining an opposition party was never my intention,"" said Mr Lim.

The father of three young boys, Mr Lim said more support needs to be given to parents with growing children and current schemes were inadequate to improve the total fertility rate.

He proposed more budgetary aid for young families, rent subsidies for couples waiting for their Build-To-Order flats and more family-friendly practices at the workplace.

A single mother of an 11-year-old girl, Ms Manickam worked in the Singapore Armed Forces for seven years as a platoon commander and was in the first batch of women officers integrated into the tri-service, training alongside men.

She then left for the private sector where she has chalked up 30 years of experience in human resource management and learning development, of which 15 years have been spent as an adult educator.

She has a master's degree in lifelong learning.

Education is an issue close to her heart and Ms Manickam called for less administrative work for teachers, smaller class sizes and a more balanced education system.

""We have a lot of fantastic initiatives... But the way they are being executed is something we need to look into.""

She is part of PSP's five-member team that will contest in Nee Soon GRC.

The second-youngest candidate in the Progress Singapore Party's slate, Mr Soon is in the team contesting in Tanjong Pagar GRC. He said he was content handing out fliers when he joined the party, but becoming a father of a seven-week-old daughter pushed him to take the plunge into electoral politics.

""Many things started to click and as I started walking the ground - I realised that I am indeed called to be here because of what I believe in.""

Before joining Singapore Airlines as a pilot in late 2015, Mr Soon ran an aviation business which he started when he was 23 and was studying business management at RMIT University in Singapore. To develop the venture, he went to the United States on his own to build his own network of business contacts.

""People always say that I'm crazy. I do things normal people won't think of doing; firstly, starting a business at such a young age, then venturing overseas on my own and now, of course, joining politics,"" he said.

He started his career with the Singapore Fire Brigade in 1975 before becoming an engineer, and has seven children - four daughters and three sons - as well as two grandchildren.

In 2006, he was part of the Singapore Democratic Alliance team that contested in Tampines GRC and got 31.49 per cent of the vote.

After a stint working in Dubai, he returned home.

In the upcoming polls, he will be fielded in Chua Chu Kang GRC.

""During my walkabouts way back in 2006, I could see people were displaced. Now, I come back in 2020, and it is the same kind of situation,"" he said. ""The important thing is to narrow the income gap to give these people the opportunity to improve their lives.""

31,31,WP,https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/time-will-tell-what-low-thia-khiangs-legacy-in-politics-is,2020-06-27 05:00:00+08:00,Singapore GE2020: Time will tell what Low Thia Khiang's legacy in politics is,"When news broke on Thursday of opposition stalwart Low Thia Khiang's retirement from electoral politics, a big question on the minds of many political pundits was how this would affect the chances of the Workers' Party (WP).

For years, Mr Low, 63, has been the face of the party.

Even now, nine years after he left Hougang SMC to lead a team at Aljunied GRC in 2011, some Hougang residents declare that they will vote for any WP candidate there, just because they trust the man they affectionately refer to as ""Ah Low"".

But is it merely a cult of personality that draws voters to the party?

Asked on Thursday how his decision to step down would affect the WP at the polls, Mr Low said with a laugh: ""I do not know how many voters vote solely because of me.""

He added: ""I have always maintained that a party cannot depend on just an individual or a few individuals.""

It is a position he has hewed closely to.

As a member of the party since 1982, he had witnessed first-hand how disruptive it could be if a party's fate was tied too closely to a personality.

When he took over as party chief in 2001, the WP was in disarray.

Its erstwhile secretary-general J.B. Jeyaretnam had been bankrupted by lawsuits and could not contest elections.

The resulting internal strife, with Mr Low blamed for not doing enough to help Mr Jeyaretnam, almost caused the opposition to become ""extinct"", Mr Low had said.

Knowing full well how dangerous it could be to turn politics into a game of personality, he set out very early to renew the party's ranks.

In 2001, he, at age 45, was among the youngest in the party's top decision-making body.

The party's current central executive committee has five members in their 40s.

Although many deemed he had a few good years left, Mr Low stepped down as party chief in 2018, making way for current secretary-general Pritam Singh.

Since then, he has kept a low profile in Parliament, perhaps to ensure his successor is not eclipsed by him.

On Thursday, Mr Low said he was once asked by a reporter what the WP could do for voters with just one person in Parliament.

""My answer was, the reality is that what a party can do depends on how the people sustain it. Of course, as one person, there are limitations to what I can do.

""With more people... the People's Action Party (PAP) will see that voters have more support for the opposition... and they will rethink their policies.""

To attract enough of the middle ground to sustain the WP, he had also set out to transform the WP into what he has described as a ""responsible opposition party"" that people would respect.

The first change along this direction was a seemingly insignificant one - changing the sartorial style of WP members.

In a 2011 interview with The Straits Times, Mr Low said one of his earliest tasks as party chief was to nag WP members to dress more neatly for walkabouts instead of doing it in their preferred attire of T-shirts and slippers.

""I think if we want to move together as a party and you want people to look at you, to respect you, you have to respect yourself with more discipline,"" he added.

When he joined the WP, the party under Mr Jeyaretnam took a more adversarial approach.

But Mr Low never believed in opposing for the sake of doing so, and transformed the party in his mould.

Under his leadership, the WP has taken a more moderate line and in the process created a brand of opposition politics based on constructive criticism.

Even the PAP has described him as a ""constructive opposition politician"".

Describing how the party has evolved on Thursday, Mr Low acknowledged that less combative, aggressive politics is what the new generation of Singaporeans want.

""I would think that I am more aggressive, but the younger generation like Pritam and Leon, maybe they want a different approach, which I think is not a bad thing,"" he said, referring to Mr Singh and Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera.

""They respond appropriately and they make a point, although they don't go for some attack here and there like me. But never mind, lah.""

After taking over, Mr Singh has often reiterated that he would continue on the path Mr Low has set to make the WP ""a loyal opposition which is interested in Singapore and Singaporeans"".

It has been nine years since Mr Low left Hougang to lead the WP's charge in neighbouring Aljunied GRC, and since then, Hougang has gone through two other WP MPs and will see a third WP candidate this coming election.

Yet, there continues to be die-hard supporters in Hougang who have kept their allegiance to Mr Low, even after his departure from the single-seat constituency.

While he still remains a WP member, his stepping down from electoral politics may not have much effect on their vote.

But in Aljunied GRC, where he has not gained the same traction, there is a chance that some voters, who have voted for the WP to keep Mr Low in Parliament, may no longer feel the need to do so.

Just how this ""Low Thia Khiang effect"" will affect the WP's chances at the ballot box is anyone's guess.

For many, his biggest achievement as a politician is in leading an opposition party to victory in Aljunied GRC in 2011.

But it remains to be seen if his biggest contribution to Singapore's political development will be in building up an opposition party larger than himself, and creating a brand of constructive politics that will survive the test of time.

It is undeniable that the WP of today has the imprint of Mr Low all over it.

As his influence slowly fades, it is up to the WP's current leaders to show they will remain steadfast to these values so that voters will know that even without Mr Low, they will get in the WP an opposition that wants to serve as a check on the Government, and not replace it.",0.34826515151515164,0.08801704545454545,Positive

That's the kind of external situation Singapore, the little red cork bobbing on the channel connecting the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, is facing as it goes into an election in times such as it has never seen before.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong referred to it this week when he announced the July 10 parliamentary polls, pointing to a troubled landscape that includes tense United States-China ties, the looming American presidential election, the Sino-Indian border clashes and developments in the neighbourhood.

As he put it, ""we do not know what surprises lie in store for us within the next year"".

In retrospect, this perfect storm of geopolitical contest, rising nationalism and slowing economies - which is what PM Lee was referring to - had been on the bake for at least a decade. But it certainly accelerated with two events: the election of Mr Donald Trump as United States President in 2016 and, in October the following year when his Chinese counterpart, Mr Xi Jinping, declared at the 19th party congress that China was ready to take centre stage and set the model for other nations to follow.

This has now been crowned by the frightening pandemic that has claimed nearly half a million lives worldwide and cratered already-slowing Asian economies.

To understand how much of an insurgent Mr Trump has been since taking office, picture this: From the humble dung beetle in the African savannah to ancient mariners in Asian waters, the constellation of stars called the Milky Way has often been a guidepost for movement on Earth's surface.

But what if Polaris or North Star - which was what the US effectively was post-war with its bulging sinews and unending appetite for the world's goods - has gone missing from the constellation? Worse, has actively worked to disrupt it, for instance by threatening trade pacts, bringing the World Trade Organisation close to paralysis and, most recently, announcing a withdrawal from the United Nations World Health Organisation?

Meanwhile, a new Sun has entered the solar system in the shape of China, increasingly unabashed about its size and strength. It is like an Asian elephant that's discovered its true size vis-a-vis the stick-wielding mahout that gave it orders, and now demands the run of the forest.

This has set up the geopolitical clash of the century. Mr Kurt Campbell, the distinguished scholar and diplomat who retired as the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, recently noted that the centre of global politics has moved from Europe to Asia as the US swivels to confront the pre-eminent rising power.

The mix of ideology into the blend lends even more potency to the contest even as many of China's Asian neighbours and indeed others quite a distance away sense a new truth: Polaris is not necessarily the brightest in the constellation and may not even have the will to be that.

What's more, there could be a new beacon - for instance, Ecuador and Zimbabwe, two nations that have borrowed heavily from China, have also benefited from sharp falls in crime rates after buying into Chinese systems of mass surveillance.

The biggest regional uncertainty, of course, is China and where it is heading along a variety of dimensions. Events of the last 50 years suggest that China's internal struggles have often manifested externally - the 1962 war with India during the Great Leap Forward and the 1979 clash with Vietnam shortly after the launch of massive economic reforms being two examples.

Meanwhile, regional powers like Australia are going the other way. Worried about life as they know it being upended, they seem willing to sacrifice economic growth and the lure of the world's biggest market to stand up to Chinese pressure and alleged interference in their systems. This month, India and China had gruesome clashes in the high reaches of the Ladakh Himalayas as a resolute New Delhi locked horns with an assertive Beijing.

At the same time, in some regards, the US is beginning to behave like China - extracting a price to access its markets and when it suits it, fusing trade and strategy.

For all his attempts to draw New Delhi more tightly into Washington's strategic orbit, including offering to mediate in the dispute with China, Mr Trump this week unexpectedly announced a suspension of H1B skilled worker visas, provoking outrage in India's vital technology services industry which serves tech giants such as Amazon and Google. Indians typically make up 70 per cent of the 85,000 visas issued every year in that category.

Tensions are also spreading into hitherto uncharted areas, including cyberspace and outer space.

Several regional nations perceived to have partisan roles in the geopolitical contest have faced cyber attacks in recent years from state-backed actors, with Australia the most recent victim. Last month, Japan launched its new space defence unit, Space Operations Squadron, to protect its satellites from enemy attacks, adding to a list of nations, including China and India, that have similar outfits.

The biggest regional uncertainty, of course, is China and where it is heading along a variety of dimensions. Events of the last 50 years suggest that China's internal struggles have often manifested externally - the 1962 war with India during the Great Leap Forward and the 1979 clash with Vietnam shortly after the launch of massive economic reforms being two examples.

Stung now by the embarrassment of the pandemic being first reported from her soil, chafing at the security alignments that threaten her unimpeded pathways to the great oceans not to speak of access to food and energy, she has lashed out at a variety of nations, including Vietnam and to an extent, Malaysia.

In doing so, she has risked pushing countries who wanted to balance ties between the superpowers even closer to America. Indeed, as happened in 2016, when the Chinese coast guard intervened in the Natunas to free a poaching vessel captured within Indonesia's territorial waters, Chinese diplomacy is having to scramble time and again to soothe the ruffles caused by an assertive and edgy military.

Meanwhile, her giant economy is poised to record its first contraction in decades. Worryingly, unemployment is billowing. Debt failures in the offshore dollar market have already jumped nearly 150 per cent to US$4 billion (S$5.6 billion) this year - more than the total for the whole of last year. Just this Monday, Hilong Holding, an oil services firm, defaulted on a dollar bond after failing to get investor support for a debt swap. Any domestic instability in China will radiate across the region.

The geographical plates of the Malay peninsula and the physical wraparound by the Indonesian archipelago have protected Singapore from the worst maritime disasters, including the 2004 tsunami. That said, the Republic cannot be immune to the political and economic winds that blow in from those countries, particularly its closest neighbours.

Unable to export its way out of this crisis unlike in the time of the Asian financial flu, Malaysia's corporate sector is poised for upheaval in the second and third quarter as moratoriums on interest and debt payments lift. Close to a million young people will enter the workforce by the year end with shrunken prospects of finding well-paying work.

Indonesia could be in worse shape. More than 3.06 million Indonesians have either been laid off or furloughed as of May 27, according to Manpower Ministry data. The government expects that 5.5 million people in the country's workforce, dominated by those working in the informal sector, will lose their jobs this year. There are widespread complaints of government relief not reaching intended targets thanks to corruption. Neither are elite circles, including in the ruling Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), too happy with their President. Distracted by domestic compulsions, the big worry is that the Jokowi presidency will have little time to pay attention to Asean, which badly requires its largest nation and economy to show more leadership.

It is against this complex external backdrop that Singapore goes to the polls. Whoever wins will have to navigate through choppy international waters, with navigational guides that might no longer be applicable and perhaps even have to be rewritten, and even re-imagined. The tiny Republic, so reliant on global trade and being connected to the world, will find itself tossed and turned by the shifting geopolitical tides.

It is not a happy situation for any government leader, however experienced. China, India, Indonesia - the three big Asian nations and also major investment destinations and tourism markets for the Republic - are all in trouble one way or the other. PM Lee would wish to leave the next prime minister with a strong hand. That may be difficult under the circumstances but he perhaps can take comfort that his putative successor has been well-trained for the role.",0.3814732854864435,0.05055743050808839,Positive

There will be 93 seats for elected members in the next Parliament.

Mr Singh last year set the target of denying the People's Action Party a supermajority, though he had said then that a lot would depend on the performance of the party at the next election.

Yesterday, he said the number of seats WP would contest is contingent on the quality of the candidates available and it would not put people forward before they are ready. ""We should not force that process and force individuals who are not prepared to stand and represent the interests of Singaporeans strongly, fearlessly in Parliament if they're not ready to. Good people are always welcome... any organisation wants good people and the Workers' Party is no different.""

The WP also confirmed its slate for Aljunied GRC, saying three members of its existing team - Mr Singh, party chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap - would remain there.

The Progress Singapore Party is fielding the largest opposition contingent of 24 candidates and introduced its final batch yesterday. It also outlined where they will stand. The list did not include Mr Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was introduced as a member this week.

Each new batch of leaders works with its predecessors so that the PAP Government can plan long-term and ensure continuity in its policies, said Mr Chan, who is also the party's second assistant secretary-general.

""There is a certain consistency and a certain coherence, and it is not done by just any single batch of people or any individual. That's how we perform as a team for the good of Singapore,"" he said.

In all, the PAP is fielding 27 new candidates across the 93 seats it is contesting in the July 10 polls. The party has touted the diversity of its line-up of new faces, 18 of whom are from the private or non-profit sector.

Each and every one of them has a personality that deserves to be known better, he said. They should not be pigeonholed into any particular profession or character, just because they are from a certain background.

Yesterday, the party unveiled its final eight candidates to round off three days of candidate introductions. Today, the party will release its election manifesto, three days before Nomination Day on June 30.

The latest candidates include Ms Gan Siow Huang, 46, Singapore's first woman brigadier-general, who is expected to be part of the PAP's slate in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, as well as founder of a social enterprise Carrie Tan, 38.

Analysts say that a number of them - such as former brigadier-general Desmond Tan, 50; Ms Gan; and former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43 - are among those who appear marked for higher office.

The PAP has said that leadership transition is an important theme at the coming polls, with the party's 4G leadership expected to take over the reins in the next term of government.

Said Mr Chan: ""We hope that this election will give Singaporeans a chance to look at the different parties, the different candidates, (and see) which parties can come forward to serve the people with good, workable ideas that can take Singapore forward.""

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will make it known which MPs would be stepping down to make way for new blood, said Mr Chan, who was speaking via video link from the PAP headquarters in Bedok.

Khaw Boon Wan retires

You were in my Cabinet since day one, and have been one of my most reliable lieutenants. Beyond your own portfolios, your comments on matters put before Cabinet always went to the heart of the matter, and focused our minds on the key considerations and trade-offs... for the younger ministers, you have been a role model and a source of sage advice. PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG, on Mr Khaw Boon Wan

One political veteran who is bowing out is Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who has made a name for himself as the Cabinet's ""Mr Fix-it"".

Announcing Mr Khaw's retirement, PM Lee paid tribute to him yesterday in a letter. Over a political career that has spanned nearly two decades, Mr Khaw has handled thorny issues including healthcare, housing and transport.

Mr Khaw himself wrote on Facebook: ""It's time to say farewell and disembark at the next station, confident that the next crew will take Singapore to newer heights.""",0.41503565878565873,0.11245559995559994,Positive

Theatre director Alec Tok Kim Yam joins entrepreneur and author Liyana Dhamirah and legal engineer Nicholas Tang, both of whom were introduced on Wednesday.

The three join former Progress Singapore Party members Ravi Philemon, 52, and Michelle Lee, 43.

Mr Tok, a 55-year-old Yale University graduate and father of two, directed Singapore's first Chinese musical, December Rains, and lived in the United States for 15 years where he worked as a theatre director.

In the party's press statement, Mr Tok, who is married, said: ""The Government's method of 'ownself check ownself' is neither effective nor accountable. It is our collective responsibility as Singaporeans to check on our Government.""

Ms Liyana, a 33-year-old mother of four, has experienced life as a homeless person. She wrote about this in a book and later received the Woman of Resilience award from the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware).

Ms Liyana, who is married, plans to champion the needs of families, entrepreneurs and the marginalised both in Parliament and in her constituency if elected, the party said.

Mr Tang, who is single, is entering politics to better understand the problems faced by his peers and to help improve the lives of future generations, said RDU.

""As a society, we need to take responsibility for ourselves and seek first to resolve our problems, instead of routinely handing over the reins to the Government to manage our society,"" said the 28-year-old.

Ms Lee, the party chairman, said in the statement that the team will put the people of Singapore at the centre of all it does.

""We are also so pleased that we have (been) able to include a range of ages in our team, as well as field two female candidates to serve the residents and citizens to the best of our ability,"" she said.

RDU was registered as a political party on June 15 after submitting its application on May 26.

Its entry means that 11 opposition parties could contest the general election.

Jurong GRC was the best-performing ward of the People's Action Party in the 2015 General Election.

The team, led by Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, won more than 79 per cent of the vote - defeating the Singaporeans First party, which was dissolved on Thursday.

Mr Tok first contested in 2011 as a Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate in the single-seat ward of Bukit Panjang, where he lost.

The Yale University graduate, who holds a Master of Fine Arts, wrote and directed his first film, A Big Road, in Shanghai, which was nominated for the Best Film Award when it premiered at the Singapore International Film Festival.

In 2015, while living in the United States, he was invited by the Singapore International Festival of Arts to write and direct Nanyang: The Musical. He has been living here since.

""I believe in Singapore and Singaporeans,"" said the father of two.

""We have come this far because different ideas were allowed to contest and compete to shape our economic, social and security landscape. We should retain and protect this strength.""

Ms Liyana was homeless at 22.

At the time, she lived in a tent on Sembawang Beach while pregnant with her third child.

She wrote about her experience in a book titled Homeless: The Untold Story Of A Mother's Struggle In Crazy Rich Singapore.

The mother of four now lives in a four-room Housing Board flat.

She said she has not forgotten her struggles and, if elected, will champion the needs of marginalised families and entrepreneurs.

""I am concerned about the care and growth of current and future generations,"" she added

""Helping them live with dignity, respect and motivation is important for me.""

The youngest face in RDU's Jurong GRC slate, Mr Tang said Singapore needs a shift in policy and thinking in order to help those who are less fortunate.

""From the manicured gardens and spotless streets built on the backs of cheap migrant labour, to the banning of PMDs (personal mobility devices) - all these hide an underlying issue: that we need more empathy for the problems faced by some of the least well-off residents of our population,"" said Mr Tang.

""This empathy must be reflected in both our policies and mindset.""

At the heart of the dispute is whether PSP had agreed to give up contesting Yio Chu Kang SMC in return for RP making way in West Coast GRC.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock's PSP says that no such agreement was reached.

The current dispute appears to have begun on Wednesday, just as a previous one - over who would contest West Coast GRC - was resolved. After days of negotiations, RP had announced then that it would make way for PSP in the constituency.

In the same Facebook post, RP said it would focus on Ang Mo Kio GRC, Radin Mas SMC and Yio Chu Kang SMC instead.

However, PSP continued with its intent to contest Yio Chu Kang, prompting RP chairman Andy Zhu to accuse the party of breaking its promise.

""The PSP are deeply aware that after the ceding of West Coast GRC, we will be contesting in Ang Mo Kio GRC, Yio Chu Kang SMC and Radin Mas SMC. It seems like they are not honouring this gentleman's agreement that they had with our secretary-general Kenneth (Jeyaretnam). Yio Chu Kang SMC was part of Ang Mo Kio and the rights to contest should be given to us,"" Mr Zhu wrote.

Yio Chu Kang SMC was carved out of Ang Mo Kio GRC, which RP contested in the past two elections.

RP garnered 30.67 per cent of the vote in 2011 and 21.36 per cent in 2015, losing twice to the PAP team led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

On Thursday, a PSP spokesman clarified with The Straits Times that both PSP and RP had not reached a deal, though its assistant secretary-general Leong Mun Wai had been in direct discussions with Mr Jeyaretnam.

""It is unfortunate that right now they have come out to launch a vicious attack on the integrity of Dr Tan,"" the spokesman added.

Yesterday, at a PSP press conference where the party laid out all 24 candidates it intends to field, including a candidate for Yio Chu Kang SMC, Mr Leong apologised for any misunderstanding, though the party did not cede any further territory.

He said that while he and Mr Jeyaretnam had tested out many ideas, the proposals needed the approval of the respective parties' central executive committees and no formal agreement was reached.

""We have engaged in very fruitful and frank discussions throughout. (Mr Jeyaretnam) is a very honourable man... If there is a misunderstanding, then I would like to apologise to Ken and RP... But nevertheless, PSP hopes that they will not take issue and attack Dr Tan directly.

""We hope they will stop making further accusations. Let us all focus on the general election,"" he added.

The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, in a statement yesterday, listed these measures for the public to follow when supporting candidates as well as when they meet them on their walkabouts and door-to-door visits.

If they should encounter candidates on a walkabout, people are advised to keep a 1m distance from others, for example, when interacting with the candidates, or queueing for campaigning items.

They should also avoid physical contact with candidates and their supporters. This includes shaking hands and greetings with physical contact, such as fist bumps or high fives.

Members of the public should also wear face masks when interacting with candidates and avoid following or crowding around the candidates and their supporters.

Photographs can be taken but this should be done while maintaining at least a 1m distance and with a mask on.

When interacting with candidates on their door-to-door visits, residents should also stay 1m away from the candidates on their doorsteps and wear a mask.

Similar to the advice when encountering candidates on walkabouts, physical contact should be avoided.

Residents can invite candidates into their homes, but a limit of five visitors applies. This includes any other guests who may already be in their homes. Candidates, their supporters and residents should also continue to wear masks when inside the home.

The public are also warned against gathering around the Nomination Centre during nomination proceedings to avoid crowds forming.

They are encouraged to watch party political broadcasts, constituency political broadcasts and online rallies at home.

Safe distancing ambassadors and safe distancing enforcement officers will be on the ground, and the public are asked to cooperate with them.

""For the health and safety of everyone, it is paramount that political parties, candidates and members of the public abide by the above safe distancing and safe management measures.

In an interview with Asia Times on the political situation in Malaysia, the 94-year-old was asked if he thought Malaysia would get a better deal if the People's Action Party (PAP) were voted out and the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) - which the Hong Kong-based online publication referred to as ""Prime Minister Lee's brother's party"" - were voted in.

Tun Dr Mahathir responded: ""Well, lah, we hope there is a change. But knowing Singapore, they are not very cooperative. They don't want to change anything. Everything is to their advantage, so they want to keep it that way.""

He added in the interview that was published yesterday: ""I do hope the brother, who has differences with his elder brother, would have a different attitude towards Malaysia.""

Mr Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, was unveiled as a PSP member on Wednesday, though it remains unclear if he would contest the election.

During both of Dr Mahathir's tenures as prime minister, from 1981 to 2003 and from 2018 to early this year, Singapore and Malaysia were involved in a series of bilateral disputes, including on the issues of water pricing as well as maritime and air boundaries.

WP chief Pritam Singh yesterday confirmed the line-up of candidates to defend the lone group representation constituency held by an opposition party.

Mr Singh, party chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap will be joined by former Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) Gerald Giam and Leon Perera, who will replace former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwart Chen Show Mao, the party said yesterday, amid speculation there might be further changes to the team.

WP had on Thursday announced that Mr Low, the longest-serving opposition MP in Parliament, Mr Chen and incumbent Hougang SMC MP Png Eng Huat will not stand for election this time, in line with its leadership renewal plans.

Party organising secretary Dennis Tan, who became an NCMP after the 2015 election, will stand in Hougang SMC.

Asked if the decision by the party stalwarts not to contest might place the WP on the defensive, Mr Singh replied: ""The Workers' Party is an opposition party. We have been in opposition for many decades now. And when we fight, we fight to win.

""And we do our best to persuade Singaporeans, the residents in Hougang and Aljunied, to cast their vote for us. Now over the last five years, the residents in Hougang and Aljunied can see for themselves what we have achieved in the town, and we leave this decision on who they want to vote for in their good hands.""

Political observer Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said the WP was playing to its strengths.

""From the crop of candidates recently unveiled, Gerald, Leon and Dennis are all former NCMPs who have parliamentary experience,"" he said. These are important traits that strengthen the WP's Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC candidates, he added.

He said the WP's strategy of keeping the other three members of the Aljunied GRC team within the constituency could be to its advantage, as it allows for more continuity for voters.

Dr Mustafa said: ""The WP, as the incumbent, has an advantage. As elected representative of the people in Aljunied and Hougang, voters would be likely to give them the opportunity to re-affirm what they have done to win the votes.""

At yesterday's press conference, WP also introduced five more candidates who will be running in the July 10 general election.

In all, the Workers' Party will be fielding 21 candidates in six constituencies at the upcoming polls - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each for Hougang and Punggol West SMCs.

New faces include economist Jamus Jerome Lim Chee Wui, 44, and social activist Raeesah Begum Farid Khan, who is the party's youngest candidate at 26 and the daughter of former presidential aspirant Farid Khan.

Dr Lim, an associate professor of economics at the Essec Business School, said he wanted to take up issues relating to Singapore's ""pressure cooker"" of an education system, which he said has not produced the opportunities and wages it promised.

Ms Khan said she is running to empower marginalised groups. ""What we deserve is a country where the marginalised are cared for, including senior citizens and people with disabilities. We have a right to accessible housing for all, to a low cost of living, to better protection for workers.""

She added that during the circuit breaker, she reached out to single mothers living in the Sengkang area to offer support and distribute milk formula and groceries.

The other candidates are familiar faces who have stood in previous general elections.

Shipping lawyer Dennis Tan, 49, whose candidacy was announced yesterday, said: ""My years as an NCMP has made me even more convinced that PAP's super majority in Parliament is bad for Singapore and bad for Singaporeans. In the post-Covid-19 years ahead with likely deglobalisation, it will be a brave new world and no ruling party can say it has been there before. We therefore need more diversity of ideas and less groupthink in Parliament.""

The other two are Mr Dylan Ng, 44, who works in the finance in-dustry; and Mr Ron Tan, 35, who works in a healthcare institution's research office. In 2015, Mr Ng contested Marine Parade GRC, while Mr Tan was fielded in Nee Soon GRC.

Mr Ng said: ""Political competition will bring out the best in people, regardless of the party they come from. Coming forward to serve and to provide more choices for Singaporeans is the right thing for me to do.""

Mr Tan, who is Mr Low's legislative assistant, said young Singaporeans should step up to be the voice for their seniors, cohort and children. ""Their choices and their actions will shape and change how Singapore is and will be for themselves and for their family in the future,"" said Mr Tan, who is married with a daughter.

More candidates will be introduced at the weekend, along with the WP manifesto. In all, the party will be fielding 21 candidates in six constituencies at the upcoming polls - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each for Hougang and Punggol West SMCs.

In 2015, it fielded 28 candidates in 10 constituencies.

Mr Tan is no stranger to politics. In the 2015 General Election, he lost in Fengshan single-member constituency but was one of the best-performing losing opposition candidates with a respectable 42.5 per cent of the votes.

The shipping lawyer with his own firm became a Non-Constituency MP and has spoken up on various issues, especially those related to transport, and the maritime and air transport industries.

""We need a much more balanced Parliament with constructive elected opposition to deal with important issues affecting Singaporeans such as jobs, fair hiring, cost of living, retirement adequacy and the future economy,"" he said yesterday.

Mr Tan will be defending the WP's stronghold in Hougang SMC, which he said knows better than any other constituency in Singapore how important it is to have an alternative voice in Parliament. The seat has been held by the Workers' Party since 1991.

""We're very grateful to Hougang voters all these years for their support for the Workers' Party. And all I would say in a humble way is that I will do my best to win the mandate of the Hougang voters again,"" said Mr Tan, who is married with a four-year-old daughter.

Even though Dr Lim has spent many years of his life in an academic setting, school was not a breeze.

""But what I went through, really, is nothing compared to the pressure cooker that kids today must endure,"" said Dr Lim, one of two new candidates introduced by the Workers' Party yesterday.

Singapore may have one of the world's best performing school systems, he said, but there are still graduates who are choosing jobs with little or no future, or are dissatisfied with their career trajectories.

""I believe that we have allowed superficial success in our educational system to blind us to the fact that... our education system is not preparing our children to take on and create good jobs for the future,"" said Dr Lim, who is married with an eight-month-old daughter.

""I do not wish to leave a legacy where the next generation feels unprepared to confront the future, even though it has done exactly all that we have asked it to do.""

Such difficult questions, he said, can be resolved only with a healthy, active and honest debate in Parliament.

Mr Ng entered politics in 2015 and was fielded as a Workers' Party candidate in Marine Parade GRC.

It was the first time since Singapore's inde-pendence that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) was challenged for every available seat in Parliament.

Looking back on the years when many constituencies went unchallenged, the last thing Mr Ng wants to see is the return of walkover victories for the PAP.

""To me, Nomination Day is more important than Polling Day.

""I think (walkovers) are not healthy for the political landscape in Singapore,"" he said at a press conference yesterday.

Mr Ng, a Christian, is married with two children, and has 20 years of experience in the banking and finance sector.

He said he spent the circuit breaker period helping a non-governmental organisation distribute laptops islandwide to households with children who needed them for home-based learning.

He was coy when asked if he would return to Marine Parade to try again this year.

""I will leave it to the party to decide, and you will know in a few days' time,"" he said.

Ms Khan has also made a name for herself as the founder and chief executive of the Reyna Movement, an organisation operating in Singapore and Johor to empower marginalised women and children through upskilling programmes and community engagement.

She said: ""I'm very passionate about workers' rights, and I'm very passionate about people having a decent living wage and being able to live with dignity.""

Mr Tan, who has a double degree in law and commerce from the University of Western Australia, said he has learnt important lessons about being an MP from Mr Low, including that an MP must serve his residents.

""You're elected to take on the responsibility to look after them, to manage the estate, to be their voice in Parliament and to assist them with their day-to-day issues."" Even on simple issues like fixing corridor lights, Mr Low would personally follow up to ensure they were resolved, he said.

""The best lesson I learnt from him is that you have to be responsible to your residents,"" he said.

Mr Khaw, who is also Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure, entered politics in 2001 and is known for having tackled thorny issues across various ministries.

In a valedictory letter to the veteran politician yesterday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that Mr Khaw has helped Singapore overcome challenges spanning healthcare, housing and transport.

""In your quiet, unassuming way, you have made a huge and lasting contribution, and strengthened Singaporeans' faith that this Government can and will solve their problems and improve their lives,"" wrote PM Lee.

As Senior Minister of State for Health during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003, Mr Khaw was on the front line, checking on arrangements and encouraging hospital staff, he said.

He also instituted new processes that were applied when Covid-19 struck this year, said PM Lee.

In 2010, Mr Khaw had a heart bypass when he was Health Minister. He paid $8 out-of-pocket for the surgery, thanks to MediShield, Medisave and his private insurance, and used the incident to highlight the importance of health insurance and how government policies kept healthcare costs low for Singaporeans.

After the 2011 General Election, he helmed the National Development Ministry. Housing affordability was a hot-button issue that year. Mr Khaw ""ramped up the HDB building programme"", cutting waiting times and enabling young Singaporeans to own their first homes earlier through various policies, said PM Lee.

One of the biggest challenges Mr Khaw took on was to improve the MRT system, added PM Lee.

In 2015, when he was appointed Transport Minister, Singapore's MRT trains travelled an average of 133,000km between delays of more than five minutes - known as mean km between failure (MKBF).

Mr Khaw set a target of one million MKBF and many thought it was ""unrealistic"", but this target has since been surpassed, said PM Lee. In the first quarter of this year, the MRT system hit 1.4 million MKBF.

""This dramatic achievement is the product of a huge amount of hard work, your encouragement for the regulator and rail operators to work together as one team, your strengthening of rail engineering capabilities, and your emphasis on the crucial but often unnoticed work of continuous system maintenance and timely asset renewal,"" said PM Lee.

The Prime Minister called Mr Khaw, who has been in his Cabinet since he became PM in 2004, ""one of my most reliable lieutenants"" and thanked him for his personal advice and friendship"".

He pointed out that Mr Khaw had also made crucial contributions to the People's Action Party. After the party saw its vote share fall to 60.1 per cent in the 2011 election, Mr Khaw led introspective efforts to identify where it had fallen short and ""set the party on a fresh course"". It contributed to the party's decisive win in the next general election, he said.

""For the younger ministers, you have been a role model and a source of sage advice. They look to you to learn not only how to solve difficult problems, but also your seemingly effortless way of explaining nettlesome issues to Singaporeans.""

Mr Khaw's political juniors took to Facebook to pay tribute to him.

""He has been my teacher, my mentor, and helped shaped my career. He has been such a great influence, I would describe him as a Titan Minister,"" wrote Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, who will succeed Mr Khaw as the PAP team's anchor in Sembawang GRC.

In a Facebook post yesterday, Mr Khaw thanked his constituents, civil servants, colleagues in Parliament and the Cabinet. ""After 42 years of public service. It is a week of high emotion for me. Gratitude fills me to the brim!"" he wrote.

The former Colombo Plan scholar had been in public service since he graduated, and at one point served as principal private secretary to Mr Goh Chok Tong when he was prime minister. Mr Khaw also worked as permanent secretary at the Ministry of Trade and Industry before entering politics in 2001.

""Throughout this journey, my wife stands with me, as my strongest anchor. Our children and grandchildren remind me of the joys of family life, and the larger purpose of nation-building: It is to secure future generations of Singaporeans an even better life,"" he wrote.

Ms Poh Li San, Changi Airport Group's vice-president for Terminal 5 Planning, is expected to replace Mr Khaw on the PAP slate for Sembawang GRC. She was officially introduced by the party on Thursday.

PM Lee thanked Mr Khaw for his service and said he was glad he would continue to advise newer ministers after retirement. In a Facebook post, he said: ""On behalf of all Singaporeans, and especially residents in his Sembawang constituency, I thank Boon Wan for all that he has done, and wish him a happy, healthy and well-deserved rest.""",0.4758776223776223,0.08587995337995338,Positive

Ms Gan made history in 2015 when she became the first woman brigadier-general in Singapore.

She served in the military for more than 25 years, beginning as an air traffic controller and rising through the ranks to command Singapore's four airbases, the largest formation in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). She left the Singapore Armed Forces in March and is now deputy chief executive of the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute.

Ms Gan, who is married with three daughters aged eight, 13 and 17, is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, where she has been active on the ground.

Asked about the common criticism that former military personnel are not qualified to be politicians, she said her military experience has equipped her with leadership skills and she has been involved in areas such as long-term planning, policy work and manpower. She appealed to the public to not rely on stereotypes. ""I hope that people will give me a chance. Don't look at me as just another general - look at me for who I am.""

Ms Ong said she is energised by two things - seeing every young person succeed in life, and watching adults flourish in all that they do.

The founder and chief executive of training consultancy Rohei said that in order to help young people succeed, ""we must first learn to listen to, see, hear, understand and care for the needs of the youth"".

Ms Ong, who is single, has been active in West Coast GRC, where she serves as vice-chairman for the Telok Blangah Citizens' Consultative Committee. In 2001, she started charity Trybe, which runs the Singapore Boys' Hostel, the Community Rehabilitation Centre for first-time drug abusers and Trybe Aftercare, which provides youth with guidance and offers support for their families and communities.

She holds a Master of Business Administration from global business school Insead and Tsinghua University.

SHARAEL TAHA, 39

Engineer

Mr Sharael began his career building race cars, and went on to handle global projects for Rolls-Royce. ""My mum was a nurse and my dad a taxi driver,"" he said. ""Never did I imagine I could do all these fantastic things with race cars, oil rigs, floating platforms and build a factory in Germany. Imagine that, a Malay boy building a factory in Germany. ""So I want to tell our youth to believe in themselves, to be inspired and to try it out.""

The father of three, who graduated with distinction in Master of Business Administration from Oxford, was based in Britain and oversaw Rolls-Royce projects across Britain, Germany, Canada and Singapore. He is now on secondment to Singapore Aero Engine Services as vice-president for strategy and project management. He was a volunteer in Bukit Batok East, but has been seen helping incumbent MP Zainal Sapari distribute hand sanitiser in his Pasir Ris East ward.

He hopes to help Singaporeans adapt to the new world of work, especially in the wake of the pandemic. Such digital transformation, he said, cannot take place at the expense of others. ""For the seniors, for the low-wage workers, and for the less able - we have to make sure they are part of this journey together.""

ALEX YEO SHENG CHYE, 41

Lawyer

Mr Yeo, a director at law firm Niru & Co, has chaired the party's Paya Lebar branch in opposition-held Aljunied GRC for more than three years. He admitted he was the ""newest and least experienced of the team"".

""Some of the team have been working very hard on the ground, trying to regain the trust of the Aljunied residents for the past nine years,"" he said. He declined to speculate on who would be fielded in Aljunied against the Workers' Party. He said he would like to help seniors and support less-privileged families in Paya Lebar.

He fell in love with his Hindu wife Priya, despite their being from different races and religions, ""because we share many similar Singaporean values and experiences"", he said. They met when they were foreign service officers in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have two children aged five and seven.

""We are thankful that Singapore is a home where children can be whoever they wish, and yet have a singular identity - that of being Singaporeans,"" said Mr Yeo, who is a Catholic. ""I hope to play my small part in growing the inclusive society that we have worked so hard for over so many years.""

The daughter of a Malay teacher and a nurse grew up in a one-room rental flat in Toa Payoh.

She went on to study electrical engineering at Stanford University and attain a Master in Business Administration from Harvard Business School. That was thanks to her family who made sacrifices, and Singapore's education system, she said.

Now Singapore managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group, the vice-chairman of the Woodlands Community Club management committee is tipped to stand in Sembawang GRC. She is married with no children.

The upward mobility she enjoyed may be harder to attain today, and that is why she wants to help those who fall through the cracks. Areas in need of more attention include early childhood education, support for mothers, as well as gig economy workers, she said.

""Singapore must always be the place where someone from a humble background can grow up to believe she can do anything she wants to do, be anyone she wants to be.""

Daughters of Tomorrow founding executive director

Ms Tan, the second daughter of a taxi driver-turned-contractor and a housewife, left the private sector in 2012 to set up social enterprise Daughters of Tomorrow, which helps underprivileged women in Singapore sustain their livelihoods.

Ms Tan, who is single and has been walking the ground in Nee Soon GRC, said she ""deliberated quite a bit"" when she was approached by the PAP to serve.

""In the past few years I've paid attention to government policies, and at times you may find that I seem to be quite critical of some of them,"" she said. But she has witnessed party members' sincerity and competence after getting to know them.

She added that ""certain people or groups in society... may feel that the Government may be a little bit high-handed at times"".

""I think that's very normal when people are required to perform under pressure and to solve problems. I feel that... I can bring my brand of care and empathy to the way politics is discussed.""

Ms Tan has a Master in Public Administration from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

SHAWN HUANG WEI ZHONG, 37

Director for enterprise development at Temasek International

Mr Huang, a father of two, is a former fighter pilot who spent 19 years in the Republic of Singapore Air Force. He graduated with distinction from the US Air Force Academy with a degree in aeronautical engineering, and was the first non-American top graduate in military performance. He was also the parade commander for the National Day Parade in 2018.

He is now the director for enterprise development at Temasek International, the management and investment arm of state investor Temasek Holdings.

Mr Huang described his 10 years as an active community volunteer in Taman Jurong as ""the best education"". He and other volunteers helped disadvantaged families and underprivileged youth by starting art, music and soccer programmes.

To address issues that led to children falling prey to drugs and violence, he helped to start Tasek Jurong, a not-for-profit organisation. Its early childhood intervention schemes provide targeted help. ""(We can) start as early in life as possible... to tip the scales of inequality,"" he said.

CHAN HUI YUH, 44

Marketing director

Ms Chan assisted the PAP in Aljunied GRC during the 2015 General Election, but did not stand as a candidate then because her two children were too young.

Now that they are in primary and secondary school, she decided it is a better time for her to enter politics. She began grassroots work in Siglap in 2000 and moved to Aljunied after 15 years. She has been Serangoon PAP branch chairman for six years.

Ms Chan, who is marketing director at waterproofing distributor Jingslink Marketing, would like to push for better access to childcare and eldercare.

""We have women who, because they have to look after their children, cannot go out to work, so we need to have more childcare facilities and negotiate affordable childcare so women can have peace of mind to go out and earn a living,"" she said.

It is also often women who end up leaving their jobs to become caregivers if parents fall ill, she added. They can be freed up to do the jobs they need to do with local ground-up initiatives to support them, and by making caregiving facilities affordable.

""(This) might mean more house visits, ensuring that they are engaged and understand the ground,"" he said yesterday. ""It's a challenge now (without rallies), but it's not a question of whether we designed it this way but the Covid-19 situation has made it as such.""

Mr Zaqy, who was speaking to the media at a walkabout in Marsiling, added that the party's incumbents will also be walking the ground more in the coming days to better acquaint residents with the new candidates.

Mr Zaqy, an incumbent in Chua Chu Kang group representation constituency, is expected to stand in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC where he has been helping out as a grassroots adviser after Madam Halimah Yacob left in 2017 to contest the presidential election, becoming Singapore's first woman President.

He declined to confirm his move to Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, saying an announcement will be made tomorrow. ""Ideally, the situation is you'd pick someone you know who's been here for some time running programmes,"" he said.

""So if I end up in Marsiling, I will be quite lucky because I've been here for the last two years, I know the demographics quite well and I've done the work plan for the next five or six years.""

He also declined to say whether newcomer Hany Soh will join the People's Action Party's Marsiling-Yew Tee team, whose incumbents are National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, its leader; Mr Alex Yam; and Mr Ong Teng Koon.

Evening daily Lianhe Wanbao reported yesterday that Mr Ong, 43, will not stand for election this time around.

Ms Soh has been photographed with him in a recent walkabout.

Mr Zaqy said he had not worked with Ms Soh in any grassroots activities as she was helping out in the Bukit Panjang single-member constituency. But should she replace Mr Ong in the July 10 polls, the latter will continue to guide her with programmes that need to be followed through, he added.

The Singapore Democratic Party has announced that it will contest the four-member Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC.

Newcomer Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim is said to be a possible replacement for Mr Zaqy in Chua Chu Kang GRC. When asked, Mr Zaqy said Mr Zhulkarnain has been volunteering in the area for some time.

""The grassroots and the residents are quite familiar with him, so that's good when you have candidates coming from the ground.""",0.3869112554112554,0.17424242424242425,Positive

The ruling party's main concern, said Mr Chan, is the same today as it has been for many years - working closely with residents to continue solving their issues, taking care of them, and also collectively taking care of Singapore.

Mr Chan, who is the PAP's second assistant secretary-general, said: ""For Tanjong Pagar, we welcome other people to come and stand. It offers Tanjong Pagar residents a choice. We are not particularly focused on who is coming or going.""

He was responding to a question on the prospect of Mr Lee Hsien Yang, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's estranged brother, contesting in Tanjong Pagar GRC in the July 10 polls.

Mr Chan was speaking to reporters after wrapping up the last of the PAP candidate introductions in a virtual press conference at the party headquarters in New Upper Changi Road yesterday.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang has joined the opposition Progress Singapore Party (PSP), which announced his membership on Wednesday at a breakfast meeting in Tiong Bahru Food Centre, which is located in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

However, he was not among the PSP's slate of 24 candidates, the last of whom were announced yesterday. PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock said the line-up will not be firmed up until Nomination Day on Tuesday.

Tanjong Pagar GRC is a PAP stronghold and the bastion of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew - PM Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang's father. Mr Lee Kuan Yew held the Tanjong Pagar seat from 1955 - when it was a single seat - until his death in 2015, when it was a part of Tanjong Pagar GRC.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling have been embroiled in a long-running feud with PM Lee over the fate of their father's house in Oxley Road.

When asked if he would be standing for election, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said: ""When I am ready to disclose that, you will find out.""

Yesterday, Mr Chan said: ""From the PAP team's perspective, we are focused on serving our residents day in, day out, and we have been doing that for the last many years.

However, he also said that candidates should not be defined by a single moment in time or in their career, but judged instead by their growth throughout their lives.

A number of negative online comments have surfaced since Mr Lim was introduced as a PAP candidate on Wednesday, from people who claimed to have known him during national service or in polytechnic.

He was accused of elitist behaviour during a military exercise and being arrogant, among other criticisms.

Others who say they know him have also spoken up for him.

Responding to a question on Mr Lim at a virtual press conference, Mr Masagos said the general election will elicit responses about potential candidates, which is not surprising.

""But also, I think it is important for the candidates who may have been alleged to be something or other to also prove themselves,"" he said.

""(This is) also an opportunity for them, if they have done something in the past, to redeem themselves, because we have seen qualities in all our candidates that make them what we think are good leaders who will serve our people well.""

Mr Lim, 42, is a general manager (specialised vessels) at Keppel Offshore & Marine. He started working at Keppel Shipyard at the age of 16, after his O levels.

He was awarded a scholarship by Keppel to study for a diploma at Singapore Polytechnic, after which he pursued a degree in marine engineering at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

Married with four children, he is expected to be fielded in Jurong GRC.

The Straits Times has contacted Mr Lim for comment.

The party has said it will be contesting 24 seats in nine constituencies in the coming general election.

Here's a look at the candidates' profiles:

Mr Leong is the Progress Singapore Party's (PSP) assistant secretary-general and will be part of the team led by party chief Tan Cheng Bock contesting in West Coast GRC.

The son of a dried goods hawker, Mr Leong grew up in Chinatown and went to Raffles Institution.

He was awarded the Public Service Commission Overseas Merit scholarship and majored in economics at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, later completing a master's in management under the London Business School's Sloan Fellowship programme.

He was a director at Merill Lynch Hong Kong and a managing director at OCBC Securities before he founded his own investment firm.

Married with three adult children, the youngest of whom is a doctor on the front line of the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Leong said: ""I want to do something more for the country so that everybody gets the same opportunity as me.""

JEFFREY KHOO POH TIONG, 51

Chief marketing officer for Asia-Pacific at a multinational insurance firm

Part of the Progress Singapore Party's five-man West Coast GRC team, Mr Khoo said his childhood ambition was to be a singer.

A National University of Singapore (NUS) graduate and a botanist by training, Mr Khoo held senior positions in the food and agribusiness sector and is honorary treasurer of the NUS Society.

Some of the policy changes he hopes to make, if elected, are: a review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between India and Singapore; a quota for Employment Pass holders; and ensuring there is knowledge transfer to Singaporean workers.

Married with three school-going children, Mr Khoo was already involved in grassroots work before joining the PSP. ""What affected me a lot was that at certain Meet-the-People Sessions, I saw people cry in front of me... It really made me think harder about what I need to do.""

LIM CHER HONG, 42

Author and chartered financial consultant

Mr Lim graduated from the Singapore Institute of Management-University of London as the top business graduate in his cohort.

After a career in banking and insurance, he took a pay cut to work as a programme coordinator and trainer at the Silver Generation Office, where he managed volunteers who helped seniors apply for government schemes. ""To be honest, joining an opposition party was never my intention,"" said Mr Lim.

The father of three young boys, Mr Lim said more support needs to be given to parents with growing children and current schemes were inadequate to improve the total fertility rate.

He proposed more budgetary aid for young families, rent subsidies for couples waiting for their Build-To-Order flats and more family-friendly practices at the workplace.

KALA MANICKAM, 52

Adult educator

A single mother of an 11-year-old girl, Ms Manickam worked in the Singapore Armed Forces for seven years as a platoon commander and was in the first batch of women officers integrated into the tri-service, training alongside men.

She then left for the private sector where she has chalked up 30 years of experience in human resource management and learning development, of which 15 years have been spent as an adult educator.

She has a master's degree in lifelong learning.

Education is an issue close to her heart and Ms Manickam called for less administrative work for teachers, smaller class sizes and a more balanced education system.

""We have a lot of fantastic initiatives... But the way they are being executed is something we need to look into.""

She is part of PSP's five-member team that will contest in Nee Soon GRC.

TERENCE SOON, 29

Singapore Airlines pilot

The second-youngest candidate in the Progress Singapore Party's slate, Mr Soon is in the team contesting in Tanjong Pagar GRC. He said he was content handing out fliers when he joined the party, but becoming a father of a seven-week-old daughter pushed him to take the plunge into electoral politics.

""Many things started to click and as I started walking the ground - I realised that I am indeed called to be here because of what I believe in.""

Before joining Singapore Airlines as a pilot in late 2015, Mr Soon ran an aviation business which he started when he was 23 and was studying business management at RMIT University in Singapore. To develop the venture, he went to the United States on his own to build his own network of business contacts.

""People always say that I'm crazy. I do things normal people won't think of doing; firstly, starting a business at such a young age, then venturing overseas on my own and now, of course, joining politics,"" he said.

Fire safety engineer

A member of the Progress Singapore Party's central executive committee, Mr Abdul Rahman was one of the 11 Singaporeans who founded the party along with Dr Tan Cheng Bock last year.

He started his career with the Singapore Fire Brigade in 1975 before becoming an engineer, and has seven children - four daughters and three sons - as well as two grandchildren.

In 2006, he was part of the Singapore Democratic Alliance team that contested in Tampines GRC and got 31.49 per cent of the vote.

After a stint working in Dubai, he returned home.

In the upcoming polls, he will be fielded in Chua Chu Kang GRC.

""During my walkabouts way back in 2006, I could see people were displaced. Now, I come back in 2020, and it is the same kind of situation,"" he said. ""The important thing is to narrow the income gap to give these people the opportunity to improve their lives.""

MICHAEL CHUA, 55

Runs a private firm in the environmental sector

Mr Chua is the organising secretary of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), and one of its 12 founding members. He has been involved in party activities in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

""I believe that I have no right to urge others to step forward, if I myself am not willing to take the plunge. I must have skin in the game. I must be at the forefront to share how we can do better.""

Mr Chua was a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Merit Scholarship recipient in 1985. He left active service in 2002 as a major and moved to the private sector, but continued doing national service as a deputy brigade commander until 2016.

""These experiences... shaped my thinking on how we can tackle the challenges the country faces, particularly the systemic problems that exist as a result of the structural deficiencies from an ever more rigid bureaucracy.""

NADARAJAH LOGANATHAN, 57

Co-founder of a skills-training firm

The former military officer is expected to be on the party's A-team in West Coast GRC.

Mr Loganathan served in the SAF for 25 years, retiring in February 2009 as a lieutenant-colonel. He went on to start a skills-training firm.

He said that he will focus on education policies and push for Singaporeans to be placed first in all job opportunities.

Mr Loganathan has been volunteering with the Hindu Endowment Board since 2016, leading a team of volunteers to manage the crowds during Thaipusam.

He was also actively involved in the Indian Activities and Educational Committee in Limbang Community Club from 2015, until he joined the PSP in January last year.

""I've settled my family. My three girls are all graduating or going to graduate very soon. And so I will look at how to then help the country,"" said Mr Loganathan.

KUMARAN PILLAI, 49

Runs a consultancy to develop start-ups

The former publisher of the website The Independent Singapore confirmed that he will be running in the new single-seat ward of Kebun Baru.

""I guess the cat is out of the bag for Kebun Baru. I've been walking the ground there. I've been doing my walkabouts at the Mayflower Market and in Sembawang Hills.""

Mr Kumaran left his post at the website in February this year after he entered politics.

He has been active in the start-up scene, running an incubator backed by Spring Singapore to launch about 28 local start-ups.

Mr Kumaran said an excessive focus on the economy has seen many in society left behind by government policies.

He said that after commenting and writing about politics for close to seven years, he was convinced by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, the party's secretary-general, that it is not enough and he needs to take the fight into Parliament.

WENDY LOW, 43

Lawyer

Ms Low was a partner at Rajah & Tann from 2008 to 2017, and currently leads the intellectual property advisory and dispute practice of Eldan Law LLP.

She has been spotted in party walkabouts in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

She has advocated for women's issues with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Hong Kong and Singapore, including in the Association of Women for Action and Research.

Ms Low has also been volunteering with Justice Without Borders, a cross-border NGO providing pro bono legal help to domestic workers in Singapore who have been abused or unfairly treated at work.

She said she has a passion for looking at issues of deep inequality, and wants to change the common mindset here that NGOs are ""just trying to be difficult"". Instead, Ms Low said they can drive long-term positive changes for people impacted by certain issues, and help the Government make better policies too.

She also hopes to preserve local art, culture and heritage, and leverage on technology to let women and freelancers gain meaningful home-based employment.

DAMIEN TAY, 51

Customer service manager

Mr Tay has three decades of commercial operations experience in multinational corporations in the electronics, retail and medical industries. He has been spotted in party walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC.

Currently a customer service manager, Mr Tay has three broad areas which he wishes to effect change in.

First, he wants better job opportunities for Singaporeans, in the light of the disproportionate number of foreigners in Singapore's workforce due to globalisation.

He also wants to bridge the inequality gap for a more equitable and proportionate distribution of wealth.

Each new batch of leaders works with its predecessors so that the PAP Government can plan long term and ensure continuity in its policies, said Mr Chan, who is also the party's second assistant secretary-general.

""There is a certain consistency and a certain coherence, and it is not done by just any single batch of people or any individual. That's how we perform as a team for the good of Singapore,"" he said.

In all, the PAP is fielding 27 new candidates across the 93 seats it is contesting in the July 10 polls. The party has touted the diversity of its line-up of new faces, 18 of whom are from the private or non-profit sector.

Each and every one of them has a personality that deserves to be known better, he said. They should not be pigeonholed into any particular profession or character, just because they are from a certain background.

On Friday (June 26), the party unveiled its final eight candidates to round off three days of candidate introductions. On Saturday, the party will release its election manifesto, three days before Nomination Day next Tuesday.

The latest candidates include Ms Gan Siow Huang, 46, Singapore's first woman brigadier-general, who is expected to be part of the PAP's slate in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, as well as charity founder Carrie Tan, 38.

Analysts say that a number of them - such as former brigadier-general Desmond Tan, 50, Ms Gan, and former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43 - are among those who appear marked for higher office.

The PAP has said that leadership transition is an important theme at the coming polls, with the party's 4G leadership expected to take over the reins in the next term of government.

Said Mr Chan: ""We hope that this election will give Singaporeans a chance to look at the different parties, the different candidates, (and see) which parties can come forward to serve the people with good, workable ideas that can take Singapore forward.""

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will make it known which MPs would be stepping down to make way for new blood, said Mr Chan, who was speaking via video link from the PAP headquarters in Bedok.

One political veteran who is bowing out is Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who has made a name for himself as the Cabinet's ""Mr Fix-it"".

Announcing Mr Khaw's retirement, PM Lee paid tribute to him on Friday in a letter. Over a political career that has spanned nearly two decades, Mr Khaw had handled thorny issues including healthcare, housing and transport.

Mr Khaw himself wrote on Facebook: ""It's time to say farewell and disembark at the next station, confident that the next crew will take Singapore to newer heights.""",0.40670611894016145,0.10775229498633751,Positive

The Transport Minister is retiring from politics after 19 years, in an election season that has also seen two other veterans announce their departure - former opposition leader Low Thia Khiang of the Workers' Party and former prime minister Goh Chok Tong.

It was Mr Goh who persuaded Mr Khaw, his former principal private secretary, to stand as a People's Action Party candidate back in 2001.

Since then, Mr Khaw, 67, has earned a reputation as Mr Fix-it due to his knack for solving hot-button issues that others struggled to come to grips with.

In 2011, he not only took on but volunteered for the high-stress job of fixing the nation's housing woes, one of a handful of issues which cost the PAP to lose vote share in that year's polls.

He moved to head the Ministry of National Development in May 2011 with ""trepidation"", he wrote in a Facebook post, as it was then ""red hot with widespread unhappiness"".

He did so just one year after undergoing open-heart surgery, yet he pledged to ""work triply hard to shorten the learning curve"".

His resolve bore fruit. During his four years as National Development Minister, he cracked the twin problems of housing availability and affordability by ramping up the HDB's building programme, boldly delinking the prices of new flats from those on the resale market, and raising subsidies and income ceilings so more young people could buy their first homes.

By the time he handed over the portfolio to Mr Lawrence Wong in 2015, the housing shortage was largely solved.

Fixing trains

That year, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong handed Mr Khaw another tough assignment - to fix transport at a time when train breakdowns were a major problem and the reliability of the entire rail network was in doubt.

Once again, Mr Khaw stepped up and got the job done.

He put in place ""early closure, late opening"" of the rail network so as to give rail engineers and technicians more time to safely complete repairs, maintenance and renewal work on MRT lines.

To raise morale on the ground, he visited depots, interchanges and tunnels to understand workers' challenges and celebrate milestones. The engineers, technicians and maintenance crews who toiled day and night were the ministry's ""most precious"" assets, more so than the billion-dollar rail networks, he wrote in his Moving News blog in 2015.

By setting high and clear targets for senior management at SMRT and SBS Transit, he also fostered a more unified approach between regulator and operators in undertaking tasks.

Sars combat chief

Besides housing and transport, Mr Khaw's other major contributions were in health.

While a civil servant in the Health Ministry in the late 70s and early 80s, he helped formulate Medisave, which every Singaporean now uses if he needs to pay for hospitalisation. He also spent seven years restructuring government hospitals, during which time he was consecutively chief executive officer of the National University, KK and Singapore General hospitals.

In 2003, he was tapped to help Singapore battle Sars and served as Sars combat chief. In 2004, he was appointed Health Minister and learning from the painful lessons of Sars, he instituted new processes and extensive preparations to ready Singapore for the next novel disease outbreak. These have ""served us well when Covid-19 came upon us"", Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote in his thank-you letter to Mr Khaw.

Over the next seven years, Mr Khaw proceeded to reform Medisave and health insurance plan MediShield, launch long-term care insurance scheme ElderShield - all changes to ensure that healthcare costs remained affordable.

To expand Singapore's healthcare capacity, he laid the groundwork for three new hospitals - Khoo Teck Puat, Sengkang General and Ng Teng Fong.

""In your quiet, unassuming way, you have made huge and lasting contributions, and strengthened Singaporeans' faith that this Government can and will solve their problems and improve their lives,"" PM Lee said in his letter.

Mr Khaw has been one of his ""most reliable lieutenants"", and a role model and source of sage advice to the younger ministers, Mr Lee wrote, adding that he is happy that even post-retirement, Mr Khaw will be available to advise his successors and to share his experience and wisdom.",0.40570768214835995,0.07834776334776333,Positive

The ruling party will also progressively introduce its line-up of candidates for the GRCs and SMCs in the next few days, said PAP second assistant secretary-general Chan Chun Sing on Friday (June 26).

He made the announcement at a virtual press conference to introduce the last eight of 27 new faces who will contest the election.

Unveiled over three days, the newcomers are a varied lot: 15 are from the private sector, including such fields as law, banking and business, while the remaining dozen are from the public service, the social and non-profit sector, and the military.

Asked if any of the new faces are of ministerial calibre, Mr Chan said it is ""premature to do any such comparisons"".

""Even for the 2011 and 2015 batches, I think it is premature for us to try to claim credit or success,"" he added, referring to the new PAP faces in the last two general elections.

In 2011, when Mr Chan was introduced along with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong and Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, they were called the ""Fantastic Five"" - touted to be the core of the fourth-generation leadership.

On Friday, Mr Chan told reporters that after he took the helm at the newly formed Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) in 2012, many had asked him if he thought he had done well enough as a minister or done enough for vulnerable families.

But such policy work, he said, are long-term projects.

""Many of the children whom we are helping will take 15 or 20 years to grow up. We will never really know whether we have done well until, perhaps, 15 or 20 years later... But we all hope that we have done the right thing, and (that we have given) these underprivileged children the best chance to succeed in life.""

The same logic applies to other policies and issues, he added at the press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road.

""How we measure success is not whether they do well today or tomorrow only. It is whether they do well beyond the short term, in the medium and long term. And how do we collectively do well as a country. That is the real mark of success.""

As electoral candidates, the mindset to adopt is, ""Never be too anxious to claim success, but always be the first one to take responsibility to take Singapore forward,"" he said.

""And if we can have that kind of mindset, we will have the right set of people.""

Mr Chan was also asked about criticisms that the PAP candidates have similar backgrounds, and the possible danger of groupthink in the party,

He pointed out that the entire slate of 93 candidates, including incumbents, come from diverse backgrounds, including business, social and the public service sectors.

""We have covered the various sectors, but more importantly, beyond just where they come from... we should avoid pigeon-holing people just because of (their) profession,"" he added.

Every candidate, he said, has a unique personality, and Singaporeans will get a chance to know them better in the coming weeks and months - ""their personalities, their working styles, the causes that they believe in"".

The PAP, he said, has tried hard to bring in people from all walks of life.

""(The candidates) represent Singapore, they represent Singaporeans, they understand, they feel the fears, concerns and aspirations of our people.

""We have chosen them from diverse backgrounds but, as I've said, they are united only by one thing - the commitment to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, the commitment to take Singapore forward and to distinguish ourselves among all other nations.""

On the lack of Indian candidates among the 27 newcomers, Mr Chan replied that in the total slate of 93 PAP candidates - including newcomers and old-timers - there is an above-average representation of the Indian community.

Currently, there are nine Indian MPs in Parliament, six of whom are office holders, he noted.

This works out to 9.7 per cent of the total slate of PAP candidates, slightly higher than the ethnic composition of the population, as Indians make up 9 per cent of the resident population in 2019.

""So the quality of our Indian candidates is very high, both numerically and proportionally,"" he added.

With the number of seats increasing from 89 to 93 seats in the upcoming election, more PAP branches will also need to be set up.

These branches will be set up after the election, he said.

""At this point in time, we are focused on taking care of the (Covid-19) situation, both at the national level and the local level, to help manage the health situation and also overcome the economic challenges, particularly the emphasis to help those who have been displaced to get jobs,"" he said.

The branches will be progressively set up according to the new boundaries drawn up by the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee, he added.

The need for all 93 candidates with different experiences to work as a team was reiterated by Mr Chan.

He said the PAP's leadership system is not one that involves pitting one batch of candidates against another.

""It is about different batches of people all coming together to serve with a common purpose. There is continuity in the way we do our policies - we reach out to the residents and we make long-term plans for the country.

""There is a certain consistency, and a certain coherence and it is not done by just any single batch of people or any individual.

""So that is how we will perform as a team for the good of Singapore"".",0.4147712554112555,0.1107300432900433,Positive

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong thanked Mr Khaw, who is also Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure, for his lifetime of public service to Singapore in a valedictory letter released to the media on Friday (June 26).

Here is his letter in full:

26 June 2020

Mr Khaw Boon Wan

Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport

Dear Boon Wan,

As you retire from politics, I write to thank you for your lifetime of public service to Singapore.

You entered politics in 2001, after a distinguished public service career. By chance, the years of both your joining and leaving politics have been marked by global crises - then the aftermath of September 11, and now the Covid-19 pandemic. They bookend a remarkable political career, during which you have taken on the most challenging jobs in the Cabinet. In your quiet, unassuming way, you have made a huge and lasting contribution, and strengthened Singaporeans' faith that this Government can and will solve their problems and improve their lives.

One of your first appointments after being elected was to the Ministry of Health (MOH). Healthcare was not new to you, having run several hospitals as a civil servant. When the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak happened, you were Senior Minister of State. You were on the front line, going into the hospitals to check on the arrangements and encourage the medical staff. Subsequently, you took over as Minister for Health from Mr Lim Hng Kiang. Learning the painful lessons of Sars, you instituted new processes and extensive preparations, to get us ready for the next novel disease outbreak. These served us well when Covid-19 came upon us.

At MOH, you also reformed MediShield and MediSave, and introduced ElderShield. These fundamental reforms reassured many Singaporeans that healthcare costs would remain affordable. You expanded our healthcare capacity significantly, laying the groundwork for Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, Sengkang General Hospital and Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, and establishing the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School as Singapore's second medical school.

Related Story In Pictures: Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan to retire from politics

After the 2011 General Election, you took on the National Development portfolio. Your immediate task was to assuage public concerns about HDB waiting times and affordability. You ramped up the HDB building programme, reduced Built-to-Order (BTO) waiting times and introduced policies to enable newlyweds to own their first flat earlier and live near their parents. These measures gave young Singaporeans the confidence that an affordable home would always be within their reach.

At the same time, you advanced plans to remake Singapore into a liveable and sustainable city. In the URA Master Plan 2014, you set out our vision to expand the city centre to the Greater Southern Waterfront, and to extend our Park Connector Network throughout Singapore and make us a City in a Garden. Future generations will build on these lasting legacies.

Having helmed Health and National Development, no one would have begrudged you lighter responsibilities in the subsequent term. Yet after the 2015 General Election, you volunteered to take on the politically spiky transport portfolio, and later to serve as Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure. Our immediate priority was to improve the reliability of our MRT system. To achieve this, you set a target of one million mean kilometres between failures (MKBF), which at the time many thought unrealistic. But in the first quarter of this year, our MRT system not only achieved your target but surpassed it, hitting 1.4 million MKBF. This dramatic achievement is the product of a huge amount of hard work, your encouragement for the regulator and rail operators to work together as one team, your strengthening of rail engineering capabilities, and your emphasis on the crucial but often unnoticed work of continuous system maintenance and timely asset renewal.

Externally, you strengthened Singapore's air hub and sea hub status. On your watch, Singapore was successfully re-elected to the International Civil Aviation Organisation Council and International Maritime Organisation Council. You pushed for the construction of Changi Runway 3, Changi Airport Terminal 5 and the Tuas Megaport. These projects have been affected by the current uncertainties, and the schedules have to be adjusted and plans reviewed, especially for Terminal 5. But we are determined that Singapore should remain an air and sea hub, and these long term investments will help consolidate Singapore's position in the post-Covid-19 world.

With Malaysia, we concluded complicated negotiations on the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System Link and the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High Speed Rail. Due to changes of government in Malaysia and the pandemic, both projects have been delayed, but discussions continue with our Malaysian counterparts to reach a win-win outcome. With Indonesia too, airspace remains a complex and sensitive bilateral issue under discussion. In both cases, your personal rapport with foreign counterparts has proved invaluable.

Besides your Ministerial duties, you also made significant contributions to the People's Action Party. After the disappointing results of the 2011 General Election, you led the post-mortem to identify where the Party had fallen short. You presented your conclusions and recommendations at the 2011 Party Conference, where they were actively debated. That was a watershed moment for the PAP. The honest introspection and self-critique set the Party on a fresh course. Following that Conference, you became Party Chairman taking over from Lim Boon Heng, and played your part to drive change from within. This contributed much to our decisive win in the 2015 General Election.

As an MP, you are well known for being dedicated and responsive to residents. You were active in bringing the community together, and infusing the kampung spirit in your residents. You took special pride in keeping Sembawang clean and green, and residents often encountered you when you took walks in Sembawang Park to relax. Sayang Sembawang, your community tagline, encapsulated your efforts to make Sembawang an endearing home.

You were in my Cabinet since day one, and have been one of my most reliable lieutenants. Beyond your own portfolios, your comments on matters put before Cabinet always went to the heart of the matter, and focussed our minds on the key considerations and trade-offs. Beyond your ministerial and political contributions, I have deeply appreciated our personal friendship, and greatly benefitted from your advice. You were the one who in 2012 suggested that I venture into social media, which I had until then considered a foreign land, to engage an audience not likely to follow my speeches and statements in detail. Having now done it for eight years, I have found it a fascinating and worthwhile journey.

For the younger Ministers, you have been a role model and a source of sage advice. They look to you to learn not only how to solve difficult problems, but also your seemingly effortless way of explaining nettlesome issues to Singaporeans. I am thus happy that even after you retire, you have agreed to continue to be available to advise your successors on the issues that you have handled as a Minister, and to share with them your experience and wisdom.

On behalf of all Singaporeans, and especially your residents in Sembawang, I thank you for all that you have done for Singapore, and wish you a happy, healthy and well-deserved retirement.

Yours sincerely,

Lee Hsien Loong",0.4508520183520185,0.11126086876086874,Positive

He added that candidates should not be defined by a single moment in time or in their career, but judged instead by their growth throughout their life.

A number of negative online comments have surfaced since Mr Lim, 42, was introduced as a PAP candidate on Wednesday, from people who claimed to have known him during national service or in polytechnic.

He was accused of elitist behaviour during a military exercise and being arrogant, among other criticisms.

Others who say they know him have also spoken up for him.

Responding to a question on Mr Lim at a virtual press conference, Mr Masagos said the general election will ""elicit responses which are not surprising"" about potential candidates.

""But also I think it is important for the candidates who may have been alleged to be something or other to also prove themselves,"" he said.

""(This is) also an opportunity for them, if they have done something in the past, to redeem themselves, because we have seen qualities in all our candidates that make them what we think are good leaders who will serve our people well,"" said Mr Masagos.

Mr Lim, 42, is a general manager overseeing specialised vessels at Keppel Offshore & Marine.

He started working at Keppel Shipyard at the age of 16 after his O levels.

He was awarded a scholarship by Keppel to study for a diploma at Singapore Polytechnic, after which he pursued his degree in marine engineering at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

Mr Singh, party chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap will defend their seats in the election. Mr Gerald Giam, who was an NCMP from 2011 to 2015, and Mr Leon Perera, who became an NCMP after the 2015 polls, will replace Mr Low and Mr Chen.

There had been speculation that Ms Lim might be fielded in a different constituency.

During the press conference, the party also introduced five more candidates who will be running in the July 10 general election.

New faces include economist Jamus Lim, 44, and social activist Raeesah Begum Farid Khan, who is the party's youngest candidate at 26 and the daughter of former presidential aspirant Farid Khan.

The other candidates are familiar faces who stood in previous general elections.

Shipping lawyer and NCMP Dennis Tan, 49, will be the party's candidate for the Hougang single-member constituency (SMC).

The other two are Mr Dylan Ng, 44, who works in the finance industry; and Mr Ron Tan, 35, who works in a healthcare institution's research office.

This is the second round of introductions by the party. More candidates will be introduced at the weekend, along with the WP manifesto.

The WP on Thursday introduced four candidates, including two new faces.

Research analyst at an investment bank Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, and Mr Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34, a gig-economy worker, will be running in the general election for the first time.

He was responding to a question on the prospect of Mr Lee Hsien Yang, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's estranged brother, contesting Tanjong Pagar GRC in the July 10 polls.

Mr Chan was speaking to reporters after wrapping up the last of the PAP candidate introductions in a virtual press conference at the party headquarters in New Upper Changi Road on Friday.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang has joined the opposition Progress Singapore Party (PSP), which announced his membership on Wednesday (June 24) at a breakfast meeting in Tiong Bahru Food Centre. The centre sits in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

However, he was not among the PSP's slate of 24 candidates, the last of whom were announced on Friday. PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock said his party's line-up will not be firmed up until Nomination Day on Tuesday (June 30).

Tanjong Pagar GRC is a PAP stronghold, and the bastion of founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew - PM Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang's father. Mr Lee Kuan Yew held the Tanjong Pagar seat from 1955 - when it was a single seat - until his death in 2015, by which time it had become a part of Tanjong Pagar GRC.

Mr Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling have been embroiled in a long-running feud with PM Lee over the fate of their father's house in Oxley Road.

When asked if he would be standing for election, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said: ""When I'm ready to disclose that, you will find out.""

On Friday, Mr Chan said: ""From the PAP team's perspective, we are focused on serving our residents day in, day out, and we have been doing that for the last many years.

""I'm sure Tanjong Pagar residents know us well, they know what we stand for, they know how we care for them.

With this round of introductions, the PAP has unveiled 27 new faces in all for the upcoming polls. Previously, it said it would present 26 new candidates.

Ms Gan, 46, who is married with three children, is now deputy chief executive officer of the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute.

She is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, where she has been active on the ground.

Ms Gan made history in 2015 when she became the first woman brigadier-general in Singapore. She resigned from her role as Chief of Staff - Air Staff in March.

She said she had served in the military for more than 25 years - ""one of the best choices and fulfilling choices that I made for myself"".

The armed forces, she said, is a place ""where men and women of different races, religions backgrounds, all come together, serving common goal to protect Singapore"". This desire to serve Singapore remained with her even after leaving the military.

The mission of the labour movement resonates with her, she said.

""I know the importance of bread and butter (issues) and the importance of having a job, to be able to protect one's lives, and their families"".

Asked about criticism that former military personnel are not qualified to be politicians, Ms Gan said she takes pride in her military experience, which has equipped her with leadership skills.

She added that in her military career, other than operations, she had been involved in long-term planning, capability development and policy work, manpower, intelligence, among others.

""I would say that I have gathered... several building blocks that I think are critical to any good organising entity and I would say the leadership experiences that I gained and also the lessons I learnt in taking care of people will help me to be a good politician.""

She appealed to the public to not rely on stereotypes. ""I hope that people will give me a chance - don't look at me as just another general - look at me for who I am.""

Mr Yeo, a lawyer, has chaired the party's Paya Lebar branch in opposition-held Aljunied GRC for more than three years.

He said he would like to help seniors and support less privileged families in Paya Lebar.

Another item on his to-do list is to address the challenges faced by parents of young children, who have to juggle between their work and family needs.

He said he fell in love with his wife, Priya, who is Hindu and South Asian, despite them being different culturally and having different religions ""because we share many similar Singaporean values and experiences"".

""We are thankful that Singapore is the home where children can be whoever they wish, and yet have a singular identity - that of being Singaporeans,"" said Mr Yeo, who is Catholic. He sees such values demonstrated in the community as well throughout his volunteering experiences.

""I hope to play my small part in contributing to continue to grow our inclusive society that we have worked so hard over so many years.""

Asked about the PAP team's chances at the upcoming election in wresting Aljunied GRC back from the Workers' Party, Mr Yeo said that while he is unable to speculate on the outcome, the team has been working hard on the ground for more than nine years to serve residents in the area.

Ms Mariam grew up in a one-room rental flat in Toa Payoh.

The daughter of a Malay teacher and a nurse, she said that while she had a happy childhood, there were moments when she knew things were not easy.

She would wake up in the middle of the night to find her father still working hard at the translation jobs he took on the side. Once, a burglar broke in and stole a whole month's salary that her father had just withdrawn from the ATM.

""Thanks to the sacrifices of my parents, the kindness shown by many and the quality of the Singapore education system, I've been able to go on to study at some of the best universities in the world and then work for some of the best companies in the world,"" she said.

Ms Mariam, who is Singapore managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group, has a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Master in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

Marketing director

Ms Chan assisted the PAP in Aljunied GRC in the 2015 general election, but did not stand as a candidate then because her two children were too young.

Now that they are in primary and secondary school respectively, she decided it is time to enter politics.

She began grassroots work in Siglap in 2000, later becoming the chairman of the Siglap Citizens' Consultative Committee.

In 2015, she moved to become an adviser to Aljunied Grassroots Organisations.

The mother of two, who works as a marketing director at Jingslink Marketing, hopes to speak up for low-income families.

""We have women who, because they have to look after their children, cannot go out to work, so we need to have more childcare facilities and negotiate affordable childcare so women can have peace of mind to go out and earn living,"" she said.

Ms Tan, the second daughter of a taxi driver-turned-contractor and a housewife, left the private sector in 2012 to set up social enterprise Daughters of Tomorrow, which helps underprivileged women in Singapore sustain their livelihoods.

She previously worked in the advertising industry before setting up her sole proprietorship consultancy, providing headhunting and talent development services in Singapore and Shanghai.

""I think we need innovation for the country beyond the scale of the economy... as well as in areas of technology,"" said Ms Tan, who is single and has been walking the ground in Nee Soon GRC.

""I hope to bring my experience and my skills in community building into politics and create a slightly different space where, beyond the efficiency of solving problems, we can create a space for people's feelings to be valued and acknowledged,"" she said.

She added that ""certain people or groups in society... may feel that the Government may be a little bit high-handed at times"".

""I think it's very normal when people are required to perform under pressure and to solve problems. I feel that by being in politics, I can bring my brand of care and empathy to the way politics is discussed, especially in this age of social media, and also in Parliament.""",0.34743598993599,0.09524107836607833,Positive

WP chief Pritam Singh on Friday (June 26) confirmed the line-up of candidates to defend the lone group representation constituency held by an opposition party.

Mr Singh, party chairman Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap will be joined by former Non-Constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) Gerald Giam and Leon Perera, who will replace former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwart Chen Show Mao, the party said on Friday, amid speculation there might be further changes to the team.

WP had on Thursday announced that Mr Low, the longest-serving opposition MP in Parliament, Mr Chen and incumbent Hougang SMC MP Png Eng Huat will not stand for election this time, in line with its leadership renewal plans.

Party organising secretary Dennis Tan, who became an NCMP after the 2015 election, will stand in Hougang SMC.

At Friday's press conference, WP also introduced five more candidates who will be running in the July 10 general election, adding to the four names that were unveiled on Thursday.

Here is a look at the candidates' profiles:

DENNIS TAN LIP FONG, 49

Lawyer and founding partner at shipping law firm DennisMathiew



ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG



Mr Tan is no stranger to politics. In the 2015 General Election, he lost in Fengshan single-member constituency but was one of the best-performing losing opposition candidates with a respectable 42.5 per cent of the votes.

The shipping lawyer with his own firm became a Non-Constituency MP and has spoken up on various issues, especially those related to transport, and the maritime and air transport industries.

""We need a much more balanced Parliament with constructive elected opposition to deal with important issues affecting Singaporeans such as jobs, fair hiring, cost of living, retirement adequacy and the future economy,"" he said yesterday.

Mr Tan will be defending the WP's stronghold in Hougang SMC, which he said knows better than any other constituency in Singapore how important it is to have an alternative voice in Parliament. The seat has been held by the Workers' Party since 1991.

""We're very grateful to Hougang voters all these years for their support for the Workers' Party. And all I would say in a humble way is that I will do my best to win the mandate of the Hougang voters again,"" said Mr Tan, who is married with a four-year-old daughter.

DR JAMUS JEROME LIM CHEE WUI, 44

Associate Professor of Economics at Essec Business School



ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG



Even though Dr Lim has spent many years of his life in an academic setting, school was not a breeze.

""But what I went through, really, is nothing compared to the pressure cooker that kids today must endure,"" said Dr Lim, one of two new candidates introduced by the Workers' Party yesterday.

Singapore may have one of the world's best performing school systems, he said, but there are still graduates who are choosing jobs with little or no future, or are dissatisfied with their career trajectories.

""I believe that we have allowed superficial success in our educational system to blind us to the fact that... our education system is not preparing our children to take on and create good jobs for the future,"" said Dr Lim, who is married with an eight-month-old daughter.

""I do not wish to leave a legacy where the next generation feels unprepared to confront the future, even though it has done exactly all that we have asked it to do.""

Such difficult questions, he said, can be resolved only with a healthy, active and honest debate in Parliament.

DYLAN NG FOO ENG, 44

Director in a wealth advisory firm



ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG



Mr Ng entered politics in 2015 and was fielded as a Workers' Party candidate in Marine Parade GRC.

It was the first time since Singapore's inde-pendence that the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) was challenged for every available seat in Parliament.

Looking back on the years when many constituencies went unchallenged, the last thing Mr Ng wants to see is the return of walkover victories for the PAP.

""To me, Nomination Day is more important than Polling Day.

""I think (walkovers) are not healthy for the political landscape in Singapore,"" he said at a press conference yesterday.

Mr Ng, a Christian, is married with two children, and has 20 years of experience in the banking and finance sector.

He said he spent the circuit breaker period helping a non-governmental organisation distribute laptops islandwide to households with children who needed them for home-based learning.

He was coy when asked if he would return to Marine Parade to try again this year.

""I will leave it to the party to decide, and you will know in a few days' time,"" he said.

RAEESAH BEGUM FARID KHAN, 26

Founder and chief executive of social enterprise Reyna Movement



ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG



Ms Khan will be the Workers' Party's youngest candidate in the coming general election.

But she has been politically aware and active for nearly a decade, she said yesterday.

Involved in student politics since she was 17, as well as civil society groups, she said she understands the concerns of young people.

Married with an infant son, Ms Khan is the daughter of former presidential aspirant Farid Khan, with whom she says she shares a love for public service.

""We also always have a lot of discussions about the things that affect our community, so it's always great to have his listening ear,"" she said.

Ms Khan has also made a name for herself as the founder and chief executive of the Reyna Movement, an organisation operating in Singapore and Johor to empower marginalised women and children through upskilling programmes and community engagement.

She said: ""I'm very passionate about workers' rights, and I'm very passionate about people having a decent living wage and being able to live with dignity.""

RON TAN JUN YEN, 35

Senior assistant manager at the National University Health System Research Office



ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG



Mr Tan has been active in community events for the past nine years.

He was part of a WP team that went up against the ruling People's Action Party in Nee Soon GRC in 2015. After they lost, Mr Tan did not let up on his outreach efforts.

Since 2017, he has served as legislative assistant to former WP chief Low Thia Khiang .

Mr Tan, who has a double degree in law and commerce from the University of Western Australia, said he has learnt important lessons about being an MP from Mr Low, including that an MP must serve his residents.

""You're elected to take on the responsibility to look after them, to manage the estate, to be their voice in Parliament and to assist them with their day-to-day issues."" Even on simple issues like fixing corridor lights, Mr Low would personally follow up to ensure they were resolved, he said.

""The best lesson I learnt from him is that you have to be responsible to your residents,"" he said.

LOUIS CHUA KHENG WEE, 33

Equity research analyst with a global investment bank

As an equity research analyst with a global investment bank, Mr Chua advises investors on whether they should put money in a particular company.

His work has taught him the value of transparency, disclosure requirements, and the presence of external parties, such as regulators and an independent board of directors, to ensure proper corporate governance.

""It is with this understanding that I strongly believe that a monopoly in government is never a good thing without an effective opposition in Parliament,"" said Mr Chua, one of two new candidates introduced yesterday by the Workers' Party.

Mr Chua has a degree in accountancy from the Singapore Management University and is a qualified chartered accountant.

Building a more resilient society means recognising that dissenting views should not only be accepted but also encouraged, he said.

""This will ensure that we come up with the best ideas to take Singapore forward,"" said Mr Chua, who is married with a nine-month-old son.

He said: ""I really care deeply for the future of Singapore that my son will grow up in.""

NICOLE SEAH, 33

Associate director at a multinational marketing group





PHOTO: WORKERS' PARTY



Ms Seah is a familiar face on the campaign trail, having been the star candidate of the National Solidarity Party (NSP) in the 2011 General Election. She did not run in 2015, but will this time as a candidate for the Workers' Party.

At a virtual press conference yesterday, the associate director at a multinational marketing group said she recognised that returning to the political scene would mean increased scrutiny.

""To be honest, I'm having a very stable career right now; my personal life is in a very good state,"" she said. ""But I do it for the party, because I believe in the leadership and I believe in the vision, and I do it for my daughter.""

Ms Seah, who is married with a one-year-old daughter, added: ""I want to leave behind a legacy for her where she would feel comfortable regardless of the political inclinations or the kinds of views that she's expressing.""

Ms Seah, who resigned from the NSP in 2014 and has volunteered with the Workers' Party since 2015, said she was drawn to the ethos of the party, which believes in ""building a strong and reasonable opposition that contributes to our political landscape in Singapore in a constructive manner"".

MUHAMMAD AZHAR ABDUL LATIP, 34

Grab driver and small business owner





PHOTO: WORKERS' PARTY



Mr Azhar lost his left leg in a road traffic accident in 2014.

And the experience of having a disability highlighted for him the need for a more inclusive society in Singapore - a cause he hopes to champion if elected to Parliament.

""We want to be an inclusive society, but when it comes to the disabled groups, it tends to be... lip service,"" said Mr Azhar, who was one of two first-time candidates introduced yesterday by the Workers' Party.

Mr Azhar, who has volunteered at food distribution and community outreach programmes in Aljunied GRC, holds a political science degree from the National University of Singapore.

He was a marine insurance broker with an international brokerage when the accident occurred.

He is now a Grab driver and small-business owner.

Mr Azhar, who is divorced with a child, said: ""That is one thing I would like to change in society... (I want to help) disabled groups to make sure they are being assisted, that those who want to work are given equal opportunities for employment and receive the help they deserve.""

YEE JENN JONG, 55

Entrepreneur

Mr Yee ran and lost to candidates from the ruling People's Action Party in the general elections in 2011 and 2015.

On July 10, he will stand for the third time as a candidate for the Workers' Party, because he believes Singapore needs a strong alternative in Parliament.

""Only when there's competition would the PAP listen to you,"" said Mr Yee at a press conference yesterday. ""In business, we need anti-monopoly laws to keep companies from taking advantage of consumers and to keep on innovating. The same goes for politics as well.""

In 2011, Mr Yee narrowly lost to Mr Charles Chong of the PAP in Joo Chiat SMC with 48.99 per cent of the vote.

The SMC was absorbed into Marine Parade GRC in 2015, and Mr Yee was fielded as part of the Workers' Party slate of five candidates then. The party garnered 35.9 per cent of votes.

Mr Yee said he continues to be active on the ground, and has initiated community projects in Marine Parade GRC, such as distributing food to lower-income families since the start of the circuit breaker.

TERENCE TAN LI-CHERN, 48

Lawyer



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



Mr Tan is a litigation lawyer who has been volunteering with the WP since 2011. He is married and has two sons.

In his electoral debut in 2015, the WP team in Marine Parade GRC garnered 35.9 per cent of the votes against the incumbent PAP team led by former prime minister Goh Chok Tong.

Mr Tan said yesterday that what he hopes to achieve in politics has not changed. ""I hope to ensure that the interests of Singaporeans are always placed at the very forefront of the Government's policies.

""Covid-19 has stress-tested the resilience of our economy and our savings. Singaporeans are understandably anxious for their families.""

Singapore faces ""many perils ahead"" and it needs a more diverse and inclusive Parliament with constructive and robust debates, he added.

""I appeal to Singaporeans to consider whether we should continue down the same path without at least appointing a few people to call out instances where the emperor may not wear clothes.""

KENNETH FOO SECK GUAN, 42

Deputy director at Singapore Cancer Society



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



In 2015, Mr Foo ran on the Workers' Party ticket in Nee Soon GRC. With 33.2 per cent of the vote, his team lost.

He became the party's deputy organising secretary in 2016, and served in that role until 2018.

Last year, he became a legislative assistant to Aljunied GRC MP and WP chairman Sylvia Lim.

In this capacity, he has been very busy over the past few weeks, as residents have been asking for help to apply for various grants and schemes to tide them over the Covid-19 period, he said yesterday.

He said: ""In the midst of Covid-19, we're calling an election. A lot of things must be going through the residents' minds: Why am I having an election at this time? But I'm not there to help them answer that.

""In fact, I'll put that question back to them to say it is a good question that you might need us to go into Parliament to help to ask.""

On the topic of transparency, he said that WP MPs have filed many parliamentary questions about key statistics that affect Singaporeans' lives.

""Some got answered. Some were half-answered. Some got no answer at all,"" said Mr Foo.

""I find this situation totally unacceptable, and we need to have a strong opposition presence in Parliament to hold the Government accountable for its actions.""

NATHANIEL KOH KIM KUI, 36

Digital product owner at a multinational organisation



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



For the past five years, Mr Nathaniel Koh was the friendly face greeting those who turned up at the Meet-the-People sessions of Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh.

Yesterday, he was unveiled as one of the new faces the party will field this election.

Mr Koh, who was described as a ""GE veteran"" by WP party chairman Sylvia Lim yesterday, was an election agent and volunteer for the campaign of WP Sengkang West candidate Koh Choon Yong in 2011 and 2015.

Explaining why he decided to take the plunge as a candidate only now, after having been in the party since 2009, he said: ""I am standing in this election as a continuation of my journey to serve Singapore and Singaporeans, to help put Singapore on the clearer path to navigate the challenges ahead, and to make Singapore better than it is today.""

If elected, he said he hopes to champion the cause of young families.

Mr Koh, whose wife is expecting their first child, said he wanted to reduce the obstacles that young parents face in caring for their children by looking at social and not just financial incentives.

MUHAMMAD FADLI MOHAMMED FAWZI, 40

Lawyer with Inkwell Law Corporation



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



It was a soft spot for the underdog that got Mr Muhammad Fadli interested in opposition politics.

""We would always fight hard but always lose. But when we won, such as in Aljunied in 2011, it was something special. I guess I saw part of myself in that struggle - always having to fight harder and facing more difficulties to earn your place in the world,"" he said yesterday.

""But, to be honest, I would have it no other way.""

Having graduated from the National University of Singapore with a master's degree in sociology, Mr Muhammad Fadli worked for five years at the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore. He went on to earn a Juris Doctor from the Singapore Management University.

Yesterday, he said: ""Many voters are sometimes afraid to vote for us, thinking that having more opposition will weaken the country. But this is exactly the opposite. When the Workers' Party speaks out, we are speaking out on behalf of Singaporeans who, for one reason or the other, feel that they are being left behind as the country moves forward.""

He added that with the WP in Parliament, the Government would be more responsive, and ""when we speak truth to power, we do so constructively because we believe that only by doing so can we make Singapore the inclusive and resilient country that each and every Singapore citizen deserves"".

TAN CHEN CHEN, 38

Contracts administrator working on energy and chemical projects



ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI



Ms Tan Chen Chen may not have been a top student when she was in school, but she hopes that voters will give her a chance as she is ""willing to work hard and against the odds for what she wants"".

Since 2015, she has been volunteering at the Bedok Reservoir-Punggol ward of Aljunied GRC, helping out at the Meet-the-People sessions of former Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang.

Yesterday, as she was introduced as the WP's new face, she said in Mandarin: ""I hope there can be more (opposition MPs) in Parliament who will speak up on behalf of the people and help improve their lives, and not just oppose for the sake of opposing.""

She urged young Singaporeans to take an interest in politics, as it is necessary for them to chart their future.

The mother of a three-month-old child said the affordability of housing for young people is an issue close to her heart. She estimated that after buying a flat in a non-mature estate, a young couple will have to spend the next 30 years or so paying off the mortgage. ""By the time they reach 55, there will not be much left in their Central Provident Fund. How will we enjoy life?

""No party has given more to opposition unity than PV has, and we hope that this unified spirit will see all the opposition parties to a resounding and historic victory come July 11,"" said Mr Lim.

The party has not announced its candidates yet.

In a Facebook live broadcast on Wednesday, Mr Lim said he would be striving for a ""Singapore-first society"", and that PV would be addressing a range of topics, including economic issues, the Government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act.

The two former military men introduced are PSP organising secretary Michael Chua, 55, who has been spotted in party activities in Tanjong Pagar GRC, and Mr Nadarajah Loganathan, 57, the co-founder of a skills-training firm, who is expected to be on the party's A-team in West Coast GRC.

Mr Chua was an SAF Merit Scholarship recipient in 1985. He left active service in 2002 as a major and continued doing national service as a deputy brigade commander until 2016.

Mr Loganathan retired from the military in 2009 as a lieutenant-colonel.

The other three candidates introduced yesterday are: lawyer Wendy Low, 43, who is also believed to be in the Tanjong Pagar GRC team; customer service manager Damien Tay, 51, who has been seen on walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC; and Mr Kumaran Pillai, 57, former publisher of the website The Independent Singapore, who confirmed that he will be running in the newly carved out single-seat ward of Kebun Baru.

Dr Tan, 80, said during the press conference that the five are ordinary people who just want to serve the country, and who subscribe to his message that ""Singapore should change for the better"".

""They represent a spread of talent from all walks of life. Some may be more specialised, some may be just bringing their working experience to share with us, and also some of their involvement in NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and the private sector, and also some of them have worked before in the government sector,"" he said.

""They will bring along with them a lot of such experiences from all different sectors of our community and of our country.""

Asked about how age factored into his choice of candidates, given the five are all in their 40s and 50s, Dr Tan said that age was not a consideration.

FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE They represent a spread of talent from all walks of life. Some may be more specialised, some may be just bringing their working experience to share with us, and also some of their involvement in NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and the private sector, and also some of them have worked before in the government sector.

MICHAEL CHUA, 55

Runs a private firm in the environmental sector

Mr Chua is the organising secretary of the Progress Singapore Party (PSP), and one of its 12 founding members. He has been involved in party activities in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

""I believe that I have no right to urge others to step forward, if I myself am not willing to take the plunge. I must have skin in the game. I must be at the forefront to share how we can do better.""

Mr Chua was a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Merit Scholarship recipient in 1985. He left active service in 2002 as a major and moved to the private sector, but continued doing national service as a deputy brigade commander until 2016.

""These experiences... shaped my thinking on how we can tackle the challenges the country faces, particularly the systemic problems that exist as a result of the structural deficiencies from an ever more rigid bureaucracy.""

NADARAJAH LOGANATHAN, 57

Co-founder of a skills-training firm

The former military officer is expected to be on the party's A-team in West Coast GRC.

Mr Loganathan served in the SAF for 25 years, retiring in February 2009 as a lieutenant-colonel. He went on to start a skills-training firm.

He said that he will focus on education policies and push for Singaporeans to be placed first in all job opportunities.

Mr Loganathan has been volunteering with the Hindu Endowment Board since 2016, leading a team of volunteers to manage the crowds during Thaipusam.

He was also actively involved in the Indian Activities and Educational Committee in Limbang Community Club from 2015, until he joined the PSP in January last year.

""I've settled my family. My three girls are all graduating or going to graduate very soon. And so I will look at how to then help the country,"" said Mr Loganathan.

KUMARAN PILLAI, 49

Runs a consultancy to develop start-ups

The former publisher of the website The Independent Singapore confirmed that he will be running in the new single-seat ward of Kebun Baru.

""I guess the cat is out of the bag for Kebun Baru. I've been walking the ground there. I've been doing my walkabouts at the Mayflower Market and in Sembawang Hills.""

Mr Kumaran left his post at the website in February this year after he entered politics.

He has been active in the start-up scene, running an incubator backed by Spring Singapore to launch about 28 local start-ups.

Mr Kumaran said an excessive focus on the economy has seen many in society left behind by government policies.

He said that after commenting and writing about politics for close to seven years, he was convinced by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, the party's secretary-general, that it is not enough and he needs to take the fight into Parliament.

WENDY LOW, 43

Lawyer

Ms Low was a partner at Rajah & Tann from 2008 to 2017, and currently leads the intellectual property advisory and dispute practice of Eldan Law LLP.

She has been spotted in party walkabouts in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

She has advocated for women's issues with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Hong Kong and Singapore, including in the Association of Women for Action and Research.

Ms Low has also been volunteering with Justice Without Borders, a cross-border NGO providing pro bono legal help to domestic workers in Singapore who have been abused or unfairly treated at work.

She said she has a passion for looking at issues of deep inequality, and wants to change the common mindset here that NGOs are ""just trying to be difficult"". Instead, Ms Low said they can drive long-term positive changes for people impacted by certain issues, and help the Government make better policies too.

She also hopes to preserve local art, culture and heritage, and leverage on technology to let women and freelancers gain meaningful home-based employment.

DAMIEN TAY, 51

Customer service manager

Mr Tay has three decades of commercial operations experience in multinational corporations in the electronics, retail and medical industries. He has been spotted in party walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC.

Currently a customer service manager, Mr Tay has three broad areas which he wishes to effect change in.

First, he wants better job opportunities for Singaporeans, in the light of the disproportionate number of foreigners in Singapore's workforce due to globalisation.

He also wants to bridge the inequality gap for a more equitable and proportionate distribution of wealth.

Mr Tay also wants to focus on addressing the impact of climate change here.

Many in single-seat Hougang, where Mr Low, 63, was first elected as MP in 1991 and served the constituency for 20 years, still remember him with great fondness and said it was painful to see him call time on his political career as Singapore's longest-serving opposition MP.

Said long-time Hougang resident Andy Teo, 81: ""He's a very good man, I've met him before. He's a very compassionate and straightforward man.""

Added the part-time cleaner: ""I hope he stays on as an adviser to the party. I think the newer group will be missing something without him, so hopefully he will still be able to help them in other ways.""

Mr Mark Ong, 53, who has been living in Hougang Avenue 2 since he was 21, was also disappointed by the news. But the engineer said that with or without Mr Low, whom he called an ""opposition idol"", he would continue to support the WP.

Mr Ong recalled the time Mr Low visited Mr Ong's father's wake and sent the family a wreath of flowers to express his condolences, something the four-term Hougang MP did for bereaved families in his ward.

""A lot of people say Mr Low is an angry man but he is really friendly. He stands up for Singaporeans,"" Mr Ong added.

But those interviewed by The Straits Times also felt that the next generation of WP politicians were ready to step up to the plate.

Administrative officer Ranjit Singh, 56, said he understands the reason for Mr Low retiring from politics, given his age and recent fall.

Said the Hougang resident of seven years: ""He's been around for quite a while. He might be a bit tired. It's also a chance for new blood to come in and have a chance to lead.""

Besides Mr Low, who was an MP for Aljunied GRC, two other WP MPs in the 13th Parliament are also not contesting the July 10 polls. The duo are Mr Png Eng Huat, 58, who had been Hougang MP since 2012, and Mr Chen Show Mao, 59, who was an MP for Aljunied GRC.

A 29-year-old resident, who wanted to be known only as Andy, said he was more shocked to hear Mr Png was leaving after just two terms. But, the technician added: ""It is quite true that the party needs to be renewed. Everything is changing so it is good to have some younger people come in, because different generations have different views.""

Political observers said the WP's chances would likely not be affected by the changes.

Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said Hougang is still very much synonymous with Mr Low and as long as his presence is felt there, it is a constituency that the WP will win. ""It doesn't really matter if you change the candidates there, so long as they're from WP.""

He also said the WP has an advantage as the incumbent in Hougang and Aljunied and it will bank on that and the fact that it still has good people to govern the constituencies. ""All of these things are going to matter more than just who is stepping down and who's going to replace them.""

Former Nominated MP Zulkifli Baharudin said Mr Low's personality and his background resonated with residents in Hougang and Aljunied GRC. ""For people who have voted for him because he speaks their language and is very much their kind of man, it is going to be a lasting influence.""

While Mr Zulkifli said it is important for Mr Low to continue to give moral support to the WP and its candidates, he added that all political parties have to go through renewal.

""It is a big loss for sure. But the nature of political parties is such that they... must be able to transform.""

In addition to defending Aljunied GRC, which it first won in 2011, and its north-eastern bastion of Hougang SMC, the party said it will also contest in Marine Parade GRC, Sengkang GRC, East Coast GRC and Punggol West SMC.

WP chief Pritam Singh announced this at a virtual press conference yesterday, during which the party leaders also introduced four candidates.

Two of them were new candidates: Mr Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, a research analyst at an investment bank, and Mr Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34, a gig-economy worker who lost his left leg in an accident in 2014.

The third candidate introduced yesterday was Ms Nicole Seah, 33, an associate director at a multinational marketing firm. Ms Seah was a National Solidarity Party candidate in the 2011 election but quit in 2014 and began volunteering with WP the following year.

The final candidate introduced was education entrepreneur Yee Jenn Jong, 55, who was a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) from 2011 to 2015.

At the briefing, Mr Singh also announced that former WP chief Low Thia Khiang and party stalwarts Chen Show Mao and Png Eng Huat will not stand for election this time, in line with the party's leadership renewal plans.

In all, the WP will field 21 candidates in six constituencies - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each for the two SMCs.

In 2015, it fielded 28 candidates in 10 constituencies - its largest slate since the election in 1988.

Asked why the party was contesting fewer seats this time, Mr Singh said the party wanted to field its best candidates.

He said: ""We want them to represent Singapore, and to represent them well. If we can find more candidates, of course, we can consider fielding more seats.""

He added: ""It's important to focus our efforts and ensure that the candidates that we put forward can do well for the Workers' Party.""

Taking Mr Low's and Mr Chen's places in the Aljunied GRC team are two members who have been NCMPs. Mr Gerald Giam was an NCMP from 2011 to 2015 and Mr Leon Perera became an NCMP after the 2015 polls.

Party organising secretary Dennis Tan, who also became an NCMP after the 2015 election, will stand in Hougang SMC, Mr Singh said.

The WP will introduce more candidates today and at the weekend.

Mr Singh said that while this would be his first general election as secretary-general of the party, he has taken part in two general elections and two by-elections in other capacities.

He said: ""At every election, the Workers' Party fights hard and seeks to persuade Singaporeans to cast their vote, make their vote count and cast it for the Workers' Party.""

This is because the party wants to serve as a credible opposition in Parliament, he said.

""That means bringing a rational and responsible debate into Parliament, so as to represent the interests of all Singaporeans,"" he added.

Mr Singh said that GE2020 will be ""a tough general election"", but added that he and the other members of his party are looking forward to it.

LOUIS CHUA KHENG WEE, 33

Equity research analyst with a global investment bank

As an equity research analyst with a global investment bank, Mr Chua advises investors on whether they should put money in a particular company.

His work has taught him the value of transparency, disclosure requirements, and the presence of external parties, such as regulators and an independent board of directors, to ensure proper corporate governance.

""It is with this understanding that I strongly believe that a monopoly in government is never a good thing without an effective opposition in Parliament,"" said Mr Chua, one of two new candidates introduced yesterday by the Workers' Party (WP).

Mr Chua has a degree in accountancy from the Singapore Management University and is a qualified chartered accountant.

Building a more resilient society means recognising that dissenting views should not only be accepted but also encouraged, he said.

""This will ensure that we come up with the best ideas to take Singapore forward,"" said Mr Chua, who is married with a nine-month-old son.

He said: ""I really care deeply for the future of Singapore that my son will grow up in.""

NICOLE SEAH, 33

Associate director at a multinational marketing group

Ms Seah is a familiar face on the campaign trail, having been the star candidate of the National Solidarity Party (NSP) in the 2011 General Election. She did not run in 2015, but will this time as a candidate for the Workers' Party (WP).

At a virtual press conference yesterday, the associate director at a multinational marketing group said she recognised that returning to the political scene would mean increased scrutiny.

""To be honest, I'm having a very stable career right now, my personal life is in a very good state,"" she said. ""But I do it for the party, because I believe in the leadership and I believe in the vision, and I do it for my daughter.""

Ms Seah, who is married with a one-year-old daughter, added: ""I want to leave behind a legacy for her where she would feel comfortable regardless of the political inclinations or the kinds of views that she's expressing.""

Ms Seah, who resigned from the NSP in 2014 and has volunteered with WP since 2015, said she was drawn to the ethos of the WP, which believes in ""building a strong and reasonable opposition that contributes to our political landscape in Singapore in a constructive manner"".

MUHAMMAD AZHAR ABDUL LATIP, 34

Grab driver and small business owner

Mr Azhar lost his left leg in a road traffic accident in 2014.

And the experience of having a disability highlighted for him the need for a more inclusive society in Singapore - a cause he hopes to champion if elected to Parliament.

""We want to be an inclusive society, but when it comes to the disabled groups, it tends to be... lip service,"" said Mr Azhar, who was one of two first-time candidates introduced yesterday by the Workers' Party.

Mr Azhar, who has volunteered at food distribution and community outreach programmes in Aljunied GRC, holds a political science degree from the National University of Singapore.

He was a marine insurance broker with an international brokerage when the accident occurred.

He is now a Grab driver and small business owner.

Mr Azhar, who is divorced with a child, said: ""That is one thing I would like to change in society... (I want to help) disabled groups to make sure they are being assisted, that those who want to work are given equal opportunities for employment and receive the help they deserve.""

YEE JENN JONG, 55

Entrepreneur

Mr Yee Jenn Jong ran and lost to candidates from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in the 2011 and 2015 general elections.

On July 10, he will stand for the third time as a candidate for the Workers' Party (WP), because he believes Singapore needs a strong alternative in Parliament.

""Only when there's competition would the PAP listen to you,"" said Mr Yee at a press conference yesterday. ""In business, we need anti-monopoly laws to keep companies from taking advantage of consumers and to keep on innovating. The same goes for politics as well.""

In 2011, Mr Yee narrowly lost to Mr Charles Chong of the PAP in Joo Chiat SMC with 48.99 per cent of the vote.

The single-member constituency was absorbed into Marine Parade GRC in 2015, and Mr Yee was fielded as part of the WP's slate of five candidates then. The WP garnered 35.9 per cent of votes.

Mr Yee said he continues to be active on the ground, and has initiated community projects in Marine Parade GRC, such as distributing food to lower-income families since the start of the circuit breaker.

The man who helmed the WP for 17 years told The Straits Times yesterday that he decided not to stand in the coming general election as he felt his work was done.

As party chief, he had achieved the twin goals he had set for himself after taking over from the party's firebrand leader J.B. Jeyaretnam in 2001.

The first was to secure a group representation constituency for the WP, which he did in 2011.

That year, he famously left his long-time Hougang constituency to lead a team to victory in Aljunied GRC, the first and only time an opposition party had won in a GRC.

The second was to renew the ranks of the WP, and hand over to a new generation of younger leaders. Over the years, he has made a concerted effort to attract and field younger members in their 30s and 40s. In 2018, Mr Low stepped down as secretary-general, making way for Mr Pritam Singh, 43.

In his first interview since his retirement from electoral politics was announced, Mr Low told ST and other media: ""I hope that the Workers' Party itself has that spirit. The whole organisation's formation and process is important, and not just an individual... I have always maintained that a party cannot depend on just an individual or a few individuals.""

It was also the first time that he was speaking to the media after a bad fall at his Upper Thomson home in April left him with traumatic brain injury.

His condition has since improved after being discharged from hospital on May 21, and he appears none the worse for wear.

But the fall he suffered when on the way to the bathroom has left a lasting injury to his olfactory nerve centre, robbing him of his sense of smell and the enjoyment he used to get from a steaming bowl of laksa.

""Laksa has many layers to it, now I can only taste that it is spicy and salty,"" he said, chuckling.

He was quick to add that it was a small price to pay. ""Such a bad fall could have been very, very serious, but now I am mostly OK. If I have lost my sense of smell, it is a small thing, so be it,"" added Mr Low, who has been given medical leave until July 15.

Throughout his political career, the Teochew-speaking businessman can be said to have tasted, in Chinese parlance, ""sourness, sweetness, bitterness and heat"".

His experiences as a student at Nanyang University, which was made to merge with the University of Singapore, and later as a teacher who saw students from poorer backgrounds struggling, left him sour and disillusioned.

It pushed him onto the path of politics, which he felt was the only way to change people's lives.

The WP that he joined in 1982 was more focused on issues like human rights and took a more adversarial approach towards the Government, under Mr Jeyaretnam. The party then was plagued by the same problems that other opposition parties faced, with infighting and an inability to attract good candidates.

But under Mr Low, who was elected party chief in 2001, it has taken a different direction, focusing on issues of the day and creating a brand of constructive politics that strives to provide a check in Parliament.

In 2011, Mr Low described the WP as a co-driver that would slap the driver, the PAP, if the ruling party were to go off course in governing the country.

His more pragmatic and moderate line has won credibility with the middle ground, gaining the party a broader base of supporters and also a new generation of members, with not a few lawyers, bankers and academics.

On this front, he feels that the party has evolved even more with its new, younger leadership.

""Probably they are a different generation in terms of political debates. I would think that I'm more aggressive, but the younger generation like Pritam and Leon, maybe they want a different approach, which I think is not a bad thing,"" he said referring to Mr Singh and NonConstituency MP Leon Perera.

""If I compare myself with my predecessor Jeyaretnam, I think I am probably mild, right? So probably this political progress, where you become less aggressive and you can sit down and talk about things rather than just political brickbats, is a good thing.""

Asked about how he would rate Mr Singh's leadership so far, Mr Low said: ""So far, I think Pritam has been good in that from my observation (he has) done well in exchanges with the ministers.""

He added that this was true of the party's other MPs as well, as ""they respond appropriately and they make a point although they don't go for some attack here and there like me"".

The sweet taste of victory in Aljunied GRC in 2011, did not last long, and after that general election, the WP's Aljunied-Hougang Town Council got embroiled in a saga over its accounts.

Observers say this contributed to some extent to the WP's more dismal showing in Aljunied GRC in 2015, when the team scraped by with 50.96 per cent of the votes.

The town council, through an independent panel, had successfully sued the party's MPs, including Mr Low, over more than $33 million in improper payments. Mr Low and party chairman Sylvia Lim were found by the High Court to have breached their fiduciary duties.

In his ruling, the High Court judge said the two Aljunied GRC MPs had acted dishonestly when they awarded a managing agent contract to a company set up by their supporters without calling a tender. He added that in doing so, they had put their own political interests above the interests of their residents.

Mr Low, along with the other MPs and town councillors, have appealed against the ruling.

Having been an opposition Parliament member for so long, Mr Low has taken some heat from the ruling party. But he is also one of few opposition politicians who have drawn admiration from both sides of the aisle.

Yesterday, asked if the party would lose some of its shine without him contesting, Mr Low, who is Singapore's most successful opposition politician to date, quipped: ""I do not know how many voters vote solely because of me.""

He sought to dismiss the notion that the WP is the ""Low Thia Khiang party"", adding that it has evolved since he was first elected into Parliament and became the party's only representative in the House.

In the past term of Parliament, the WP had a team of six MPs and three NCMPs, and people would judge the party based on their performance and their interactions with voters too, he added.

Asked how he would like his political career to be remembered, Mr Low said: ""I do not have this hope that others will (remember me in any particular way). I have done what I should do, I have no regrets. Of course everyone will have different views. And as a public figure you have to accept them. That's all. I would not be surprised if someone is scolding me; I accept it.

""I will remember the people, the voters. I think these are important life assets, friends in Hougang. I will remember them.""",0.40127096861471867,0.08529558982683982,Positive

Taking Mr Low's and Mr Chen's place in the Aljunied GRC slate will be Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Leon Perera, while Mr Png will be replaced in Hougang by Mr Dennis Tan.

WP secretary-general Pritam Singh made the announcement yesterday at the party's first press conference in this election, confirming speculation that had been swirling on the ground that the three stalwarts have asked to sit out the election.

Describing it as a collective decision anchored on the continued success of the WP, Mr Singh said the move would allow the party to broaden its leadership base and also remain in touch with the ground as Singapore's population changes.

""For the party to grow, new and younger leaders require parliamentary and town council experience. If there is no renewal of Workers' Party MPs, over time, the party will not be able to attract new members to join and aspire to serve Singapore and Singaporeans as opposition MPs.

""The absence of new blood will set the party back in its growth as a credible and institutionalised opposition in Singapore,"" he said.

He added that Mr Low, 63, himself had persuaded him on the importance of refreshing the party's line-up of MPs for the WP to remain relevant to all Singaporeans.

""He was concerned that as the elder generation of the party ages, even as values and wisdom remain timeless, a Member of Parliament must have his or her pulse on Singapore society.

""If a Workers' Party MP becomes too detached from new norms and the changing shape of society, the Workers' Party will be less effective in speaking for Singaporeans in Parliament and run the risk of becoming irrelevant,"" Mr Singh said, relating Mr Low's advice.

All three men had expressed their wish to step down at the end of this term of Parliament and Mr Singh stressed that this ""is not a retirement"". He said the trio will continue to mentor and train the party's next-generation leaders.

""The time is right for the Workers' Party to have senior leaders contribute in a different capacity. They remain critical as the party's resource of information and experience,"" Mr Singh added.

ESSENTIAL FOR GROWTH For the party to grow, new and younger leaders require parliamentary and town council experience. If there is no renewal of Workers' Party MPs, over time, the party will not be able to attract new members to join and aspire to serve Singapore and Singaporeans as opposition MPs. The absence of new blood will set the party back in its growth as a credible and institutionalised opposition in Singapore. MR PRITAM SINGH, secretary-general of the Workers' Party.

Mr Low's candidacy in Aljunied had been unclear after he sustained a head injury from a fall at home on April 30. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and discharged after 21 days.

He is recovering and a recent photograph posted by People's Action Party (PAP) member and Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin showed him in good spirits. But some party members had said Mr Low was contemplating stepping down even before the accident.

The battle-hardened politician, known for his Teochew rally speeches and down-to-earth manner, joined politics some 40 years ago. He has been an elected MP for 29 years - the longest-serving opposition MP in Singapore.

First elected into Parliament in Hougang in 1991, he left the constituency in 2011 to lead a team to victory in Aljunied GRC, and in recent years has called on voters to help the party renew its ranks by voting in its younger members.

Under him, the WP became the first opposition party to win a group representation constituency.

Another of his big achievements as party chief was attracting Mr Chen, 59, a top corporate lawyer, to its ranks. With his credentials, Mr Chen was seen as the type of star catch that only the PAP would field, and his candidacy with the WP in 2011 is thought to have played a critical part in securing a win in Aljunied GRC.

Meanwhile, Mr Png, 58, who joined WP in 2006, was first fielded as a candidate in 2011 in East Coast GRC, but did not win. He was fielded again as the party's candidate in the Hougang by-election in 2012, and has been an MP in the ward since then.

The three younger candidates who will be taking their place - Mr Giam, 42, Mr Perera, 48, and Mr Tan, 49 - have all had parliamentary experience as Non-Constituency MPs and have been touted as its next-generation leaders.

Mr Perera has been shadowing Ms Lim in her Serangoon ward in Aljunied GRC for the past few years, while Mr Tan has been shadowing Mr Png in Hougang.

Meanwhile, Mr Giam has been spotted walking the ground in Mr Low's Bedok Reservoir-Punggol ward, and has been knocking on doors and giving out fliers with his photo, name and contact number to residents in the area.

Thanking the three senior leaders, Mr Singh said: ""The Workers' Party and our supporters have been fortunate to count on the leadership of Mr Low, Mr Chen and Mr Png for many years. And many Singaporeans are in their debt for their decision to serve the country through the Workers' Party.

""The party leadership, chair Sylvia Lim and myself, and all of us at the Workers' Party will continue working and walking together, standing on the shoulders of the values Mr Low and other elder members have built. We will strengthen and carry the Workers' Party forward to greater heights.""

News of the three stalwarts stepping down yesterday eclipsed the party's first candidate introduction session, which saw two new faces and two familiar faces announced.

The first two new candidates unveiled were equity analyst Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, and Grab driver and small business owner Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34.

The party will also be fielding its former NCMP and two-time candidate Yee Jenn Jong, 55, as well as advertising executive Nicole Seah, 33, who had contested the 2011 election with the National Solidarity Party.

Mr Singh, who was joined by party chairman Sylvia Lim at the press conference held over the Zoom videoconferencing application, did not say where the candidates would be fielded.

But Mr Yee, who had contested in Joo Chiat SMC in 2011 and Marine Parade GRC in 2015, said he was ""back for a third time"", signalling his likely candidacy in the GRC.

Mr Singh said the upcoming election, held amid the coronavirus pandemic, would present challenges for the WP, which has typically held large mass rallies to get its message out.

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat yesterday lifted the curtain on the party's selection process when he introduced a new group of fresh faces for the polls on July 10.

Mr Heng, who is the PAP's first assistant secretary-general, said: ""What we hope to have is a team that is sufficiently diverse for us to reach out to all Singaporeans from different segments of our society, different walks of life, different professions.""

However, that is not enough because Singapore society is becoming increasingly diverse, he noted, pointing out that even just looking at jobs alone, there are so many different areas.

Hence, it also looks at causes that people are interested in, he added.

""There are so many of them. And that is why it is important for us to reach out as much as possible to different groups.

We want people with a strong sense of service, who feel that they are ready and prepared to contribute to bringing our people together, both in serving our citizens at the front line as an MP and, at the same time, even if they continue their professional work, to serve in Parliament, to speak up in the various debates and deliberations, because that's where long-term policies are being made.""

They then go through a ""very rigorous selection process, starting from informal chit-chats to more formal tea sessions to selections by our selection committee"", which is chaired by Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

Finally, they are approved by the PAP secretary-general, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

Mr Heng said the four fresh faces he introduced yesterday had modest upbringings. They included Dr Tan See Leng, former managing director of IHH Healthcare, and Mr Tan Kiat How, former chief executive of the Infocomm Media Development Authority.

""But Singapore's conditions of education and providing opportunities enabled them to be their best (and) achieve what they set out to do,"" he said. ""Creating that condition remains a very critical factor if we want Singapore to continue to progress.""

The quartet also share a common purpose for entering politics - to improve Singaporeans' lives, he said.

Their concerns range from the needs of seniors to the young, he added. ""And we want to create conditions that allow our young to be able to fulfil their potential. We want to be able to create conditions to look after our seniors even better.""

Mr Heng added that the four have played various roles in unifying people. ""They have been involved in one way or another in mobilising our people, our various communities to come together to achieve more than what we could have done individually... This is very much the spirit of Singapore Together that I've been speaking about.""

At a separate press conference yesterday, PAP vice-chairman Masagos Zulkifli also introduced four new candidates.

Three other new candidates were introduced by the party's organising secretary Grace Fu in another session.

Mr Masagos, who is Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, said candidates such as polytechnic lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, whom he introduced, epitomise ""the new Malay-Muslim leadership"" that start by serving in their community but do not stop there. Dr Wan Rizal was chairman of Al-Islah mosque in Punggol and subsequently became a grassroots leader in Pasir Ris East and Punggol East.

Ms Fu, who is Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, replying to a question on the PAP's efforts to get more women into the party, said more will be participating in this election.

Out of the 26 candidates the party will introduce, 10 are women - double the number it fielded in 2015.

It is a trend the party is ""very happy to see"", she said, adding that engaging women and encouraging them to join the PAP involves the work of both men and women.

""Women these days are well educated, they are well represented across sectors.

""So wherever we go, whether it's engaging trade associations, whether it's in the people sector, my male colleagues and my female colleagues are always looking for promising candidates. And if they are women, all the better.""

When identified, the party's women MPs will get in touch with them to find out what issues they are passionate about and encourage them to participate.

When the women are ready and their family and career allow for it, they will step forward as PAP candidates, Ms Fu said.

Even if they do not want to be MPs, the party is still very happy to have them help out as activists and supporters, she added.

TAN KIAT HOW, 43

Former IMDA chief executive

Mr Tan was ""the pioneer of the Pioneer Generation Office"", said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in introducing him yesterday. Tipped to be fielded in East Coast GRC, Mr Tan was part of the team that set up the office, now known as the Silver Generation Office, and responsible for mobilising 3,000 volunteers to reach out to nearly half a million seniors.

He took up the top post at the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) in 2017. Under his leadership, the organisation took steps to build up Singapore's connectivity infrastructure, such as the roll-out of the country's fourth telco.

Previously, he was deputy secretary (cyber and technology) at the Ministry of Communications and Information, where he worked on the national cyber-security strategy.

Digitalisation is an issue close to his heart, said Mr Tan, whose father is a retired army regular and mother a nurse.

He and his wife are expecting their first child, a boy, in August. ""That has made me more conscious and reflective of the kind of society and kind of Singapore I want to build up. Helping workers, businesses to use technology to create more opportunities and for a better life is making sure that no one is left behind in a digital future,"" he said.

YEO WAN LING, 44

Chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia

Ms Yeo, who used to work at the Economic Development Board, now runs Caregiver Asia, a social enterprise that connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers in Singapore.

She started her social enterprise because she saw a gap in the provision of home-care services, in particular long-term care for the elderly.

Ms Yeo said her grandmother had been ill for a number of years before she died, and it was while being with her during her twilight years that ""I realised the importance of being able to grow old with grace and dignity"".

She hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly in Singapore to continue to work or contribute to the community. She has been tipped to stand in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

Ms Yeo, who is married, said politics is a platform that will bridge her experiences in the civil service and in the community. ""(It'll allow me to be) able to influence not just day-to-day operations of helping people, but also bring it up to a larger platform such that I can (have an impact on) national policies.""

ALVIN TAN SHENG HUI, 39

Head of public policy and economics (Asia-Pacific) at LinkedIn

Mr Tan was once held back a grade, and did not do well enough at school to enter a local university.

Despite the setbacks, he earned an economics degree from Sydney University, and later, a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University.

He has worked in the Singapore Armed Forces, with non-profit group Oxfam, as well as in investment banking.

He is now with social networking platform LinkedIn.

Mr Tan, who is married with two children, has been a grassroots volunteer in Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng since 2005, and has also been active in Tanjong Pagar GRC lately.

Mr Tan said he hopes to use his skills and experience in the public, private and non-profit sectors to help Singaporeans become more nimble and prepared for the future of work.

He also aims to do more to bridge the digital divide for seniors and other vulnerable groups.

Said Mr Tan: ""(If) by the time Covid-19 is over and we haven't changed, we haven't been comfortable with technology, I think we might have failed our people.""

WAN RIZAL WAN ZAKARIAH, 42

Senior lecturer at Republic Polytechnic

Dr Wan Rizal, who is married with four children, started volunteering in the community in 2010. He was chairman of Al-Islah Mosque in Punggol, and part of Punggol's Interracial and Religious Confidence Circle.

The Normal (Academic) stream student obtained a polytechnic diploma and later enrolled at the National Institute of Education, and subsequently, at Nanyang Technological University, where he obtained his degree in physical education at the age of 31. He now holds a PhD in sports science.

Dr Wan Rizal, who has recently appeared at Jalan Besar GRC events, said: ""Because of the non-linear path that I have taken, I strongly believe that education is the key to social mobility. This is how we can allow people who have less, or did less well, to move up and prevent our society from being stratified.""

""Singapore must continue to be a nation of opportunities for all - not for just the privileged few, or the lucky ones, but for every Singaporean.""

ERIC CHUA SWEE LEONG, 41

Former director of the SGSecure Programme Office

Mr Chua grew up in a three-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. His father was a forklift driver and his mother a seamstress and, later, a production operator in a factory.

He was awarded the Local Merit Scholarship (Civil Defence) by the Public Service Commission to read communications studies at Nanyang Technological University. He served with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), eventually becoming commander of the 3rd SCDF Division before joining the SGSecure Programme Office.

Mr Chua, a former chairman of the People's Association Youth Movement's Central Youth Council, has worked with youth for 15 years. He is also father to a baby boy, who was born about a week ago.

He said he was fortunate to have siblings, friends, supervisors and mentors who helped him grow in life. ""This is time for me to step up and pay it forward... If elected, one of several areas I'll like to focus on is to ensure that youth, especially those from humble family backgrounds like mine, will continue to have a fair chance to succeed in life,"" he said.

TAN SEE LENG, 55

Former Parkway Holdings group chief executive

Dr Tan See Leng, who has spent more than 30 years in the medical sector, is the oldest PAP candidate introduced so far and will succeed Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong as chairman of Marine Parade's PAP branch.

He said he spent two years under Mr Goh's tutelage, and worked with him on a caregiver support network for the elderly that will be launched after the election.

He declined to comment on where he will be fielded.

Dr Tan, the only child of a bus timekeeper and a housewife, grew up in a Toa Payoh rental flat. A family physician by training, he has three children in their 20s.

He is fluent in English and Mandarin, as well as Cantonese, Teochew and Hokkien.

He said the deaths of his parents from cancer in the 2000s, after years of chronic illness, strengthened his resolve to get a master's in family medicine, followed by a Master of Business Administration.

He is currently a corporate adviser to Temasek Holdings and adviser to DBS Bank, as well as an independent director of Surbana Jurong.

He was the former group chief executive and managing director of private hospital operator IHH Healthcare.

NG LING LING, 48

Former managing director of Community Chest

Ms Ng Ling Ling spent six years working in banking, but gave that up to go into social service.

Growing up in a three-room Housing Board flat in Hougang, she watched some of her neighbours struggle with problems such as drug abuse: ""I was always very sensitive to the plight of the families I saw.""

As managing director of Community Chest (ComChest), the National Council of Social Service's fund-raising arm, she helped raise millions for charity.

She stepped down from her role as chief of future primary care and director of community engagement at the Health Ministry's Office for Healthcare Transformation at the end of March. She is now a senior consultant there.

She said she had been working on innovating new care models, such as using simple technology to help people with high blood pressure understand the disease and guard against strokes.

""I see the importance of long-term holistic care, as our population ages rapidly,"" said Ms Ng, who is married and has a son in primary school.

She has helped bring in tele-health systems for Covid-19 community care facilities, and said she will continue to be part of the fight against the virus.

Ms Ng is tipped to be fielded in Ang Mo Kio GRC.

ZHULKARNAIN ABDUL RAHIM, 39

Lawyer

Mr Zhulkarnain, a partner at law firm Dentons Rodyk and Davidson, believes in building on community modes of distribution, such as neighbour networks to support the needy, and to ""entrench this idea of humanness"" in policymaking.

Over the last decade, the father of three children aged 11, eight and six has conducted free legal clinics and done pro bono work as an assigned solicitor with the Legal Aid Bureau. He was previously the chairman of the Association of Muslim Professionals.

The Straits Times reported earlier that he has been spotted walking the ground in Chua Chu Kang GRC.

Mr Zhulkarnain is the fifth of six children. His mother is a housewife and his father did blue-collar jobs before joining a construction company and working his way up to be a supervisor.

""From him, I remember the importance of lifelong learning,"" said Mr Zhulkarnain, who would go through his father's presentation slides with him as his father did not know how to use PowerPoint.

""The Covid-19 circuit breaker period has shown up various digital inequalities among our people, such as those who cannot afford digital devices to do home-based learning,"" he said.

""But what I feel is that beyond digital connectivity, it is human connectivity that we would have to look at in terms of policymaking and process.""

RAYMOND LYE HOONG YIP, 54

Managing partner at Union Law LLP

Mr Lye, a father of three and a lawyer, has been volunteering in the community for 25 years.

When introducing himself, he recounted how he and other volunteers helped a low-income resident deal with a problem.

Mr Lye, who chairs the Punggol East Citizens' Consultative Committee, said the resident's daughter had obtained a university scholarship from an agency. But the agency, which he did not name, later asked the resident to cough up a large sum of money as her daughter's grades were not good.

Mr Lye said that after several attempts, he and other volunteers managed to get the agency to write off the sum and the family was later able to save up enough money to buy their own flat and move out of the rental block.

Despite having volunteered for groups like clan societies and trade associations, Mr Lye said he finds community work most fulfilling.

""I have always tried my best to help, as no government policy is foolproof and there are those who may fall through the cracks,"" said Mr Lye, who has been volunteering in the new Sengkang GRC.

DERRICK GOH SOON HEE, 51

Managing director and head of group audit at DBS Bank

Before taking up his position at DBS, Mr Goh headed its subsidiary POSB, where he said he was exposed to volunteering efforts by community leaders and grassroots organisations.

This inspired the father of three to take up community work.

Mr Goh spent more than 10 years at credit firm American Express and was based in London and New York. He hopes to tap his experience in banking to help improve the lives of Singaporeans.

""I know that Singapore is not perfect but having lived in all these international financial centres, I can say that Singapore is the best. Therefore, I want to play a role to help Singapore adapt as the world changes very rapidly, given digitisation and the onset of the impact of new technology,"" he said.

Since 2013, Mr Goh has been volunteering as a district councillor with the South West Community Development Council and also serves on the board of HomeTeamNS.

Mr Goh, who is vice-chairman of the Gambas-Yishun Citizens' Consultative Committee, has been seen with Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam at community engagements in Nee Soon GRC, where he is expected to be fielded.

Vice-president for Terminal 5 planning at Changi Airport Group

Sembawang is a special place for Ms Poh, a former helicopter pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the first female full-time aide-de-camp to the late President S R Nathan.

She spent a lot of time there when she was based at RSAF's Sembawang Air Base.

""Now that I have a chance to go back to Sembawang to serve on the ground, I'm really excited to work closely with our volunteers, with our residents there,"" said Ms Poh, who started volunteering in grassroots activities in Sembawang GRC in 2018.

Ms Poh, who is single, started an annual Women Festival for the constituency and helped distribute food to rental flat residents.

Ms Poh, who spoke in Mandarin, English and Malay at the press conference, is tipped to join the PAP team for Sembawang GRC, which will likely lose Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan as he is expected to retire from politics soon.

The 82-year-old, who has been living in Marine Parade for 39 years, said she was hoping he would contest the coming general election. ""He is very caring and takes good care of the elderly,"" she said. ""His stepping down will sadden many residents.""

She recalled vividly how Mr Goh had come to her rescue in 1981 when she felt so helpless after she failed to get a permit to hire a maid.

Madam Chua had just moved to Marine Parade to start a provision shop business and needed a helper to take care of her two children.

Mr Goh helped to write a letter to the authorities to support her case and she got the permit, she said.

Like Madam Chua, many Marine Parade residents were expecting Mr Goh to stand again.

""Marine Parade has always been a stronghold for PAP because of Goh Chok Tong,"" said Mr Marican A.J., 75, a resident of more than 30 years who saw the area develop into a mature estate.

""Mr Goh is a sentimental person. Instead of demolishing the old flats, he upgraded them. There are also more clinics to take care of the elderly living here,"" he added.

Mr Ronnie Foo, 57, who runs a fruit stall, added: ""He has done so much for us. He is a very down-to-earth MP and he understands the issues we face.

""When hawkers like me get summonses, we go to see him. He would help us write appeal letters because he knows it's not easy for us to do our business,"" he said. ""It would be hard for you to find someone who says Mr Goh is not a nice person.""

Mr Goh has been grooming Dr Tan See Leng, 55, who was introduced as a new candidate yesterday, to take over as chairman of the People's Action Party (PAP) branch in Marine Parade.

Mr Goh will remain chairman emeritus of the branch, and has also agreed to be appointed senior adviser to the People's Association on a pro bono basis.

In a valedictory letter to Mr Goh, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that he oversaw the transformation of Marine Parade estate on newly reclaimed land to a vibrant waterfront town filled with warmth. ""The story of Marine Parade is the story of Singapore - out of nothing, we created something special. You made that happen,"" he said.

In a Facebook post, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat recalled Mr Goh giving him valuable advice during the 2008 global financial crisis when he was deliberating on getting approval from then-President S R Nathan for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits here, to be backed by reserves.

Mr Heng was managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Mr Goh, its chairman.

Mr Heng said he was glad to have Mr Goh's counsel. ""He taught us that we must face difficult decisions head-on. Having thought through the options, we must have the courage to do what is right,"" he wrote. ""It was a lesson that stayed with me and continues to guide much of my work.""

Specifically, it involves a planned handover to the PAP's fourth generation of leaders since Singapore's independence in 1965.

Mr Goh Chok Tong, 79, has been a Member of Parliament for 44 years. He stepped down from Cabinet in 2011 and has been known as Emeritus Senior Minister since then.

Even as he departs the political stage, he has signalled his continued preoccupation with Singapore's future, asking in a cryptic Facebook post on Tuesday, the day the election was called: ""Parliament dissolved. Quo vadis, Singapore? Quo vadis, me?""

""Quo vadis"" is a Latin phrase commonly translated as ""Where are you going?"" or, more poetically, ""Whither goest thou?""

Mr Goh announced his decision to retire in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.

PM Lee accepted his decision and thanked Mr Goh for a lifetime of distinguished service.

Born into a working class family in 1941, the man who stood out from childhood - not just because he was the tallest among his peers - began his working life as a civil servant who went on to lead Neptune Orient Lines before being inducted into politics in 1976, at the age of 35.

He rose swiftly to helm several ministries, including Trade and Industry, Health and Defence, before being appointed deputy prime minister in 1985. Five years later, he succeeded Mr Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister.

GROWTH AND RENEWAL

When he was sworn in as prime minister on Nov 28, 1990, he pledged to make sure ""Singapore thrives and grows after Mr Lee Kuan Yew"".

During his 14 years at the helm, Singapore's per capita gross domestic product grew from $21,950 in 1990 to more than $38,000 in 2004. A web of free trade agreements (FTAs), including with major economies like the United States and Japan, expanded the island nation's political and economic space overseas.

At home, the Goh years were about renewing the bond between people and government on terms that the second-generation PAP leaders believed in - a kinder, gentler nation, a government that listened, and paid attention not just to material well-being but also matters of the heart, or ""heartware"".

Mr Goh played a key role in regional integration, working to narrow the development gap between the original Asean five and the newer member states of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. This was done through the Initiative for Asean Integration (IAI) launched in 2000.

He sparked an ""India fever"" in Singapore in the 1990s, making multiple trips to the country, urging it to forge closer ties with the region and pushing for the conclusion of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca).

He also led Singapore's efforts to grow links between world regions, through the Asia-Europe Meeting, the Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation and Asia-Middle East Dialogue. These cemented Singapore's cultural, economic and political relevance to the world.

As prime minister, it also fell to him to secure a team to succeed himself and his peers in Cabinet.

During his tenure as minister for defence, Mr Goh talent-spotted a young Lee Hsien Loong, then a Singapore Armed Forces leader, and persuaded him to enter politics and stand for election in 1984.

PM Lee himself spoke of Mr Goh's ability to get capable people to join his team and work for him, when he launched the latter's biography Tall Order in 2018.

PM Lee said of his predecessor: ""He nurtures and holds the team together. He considers and takes in their views, and gets the best out of the team.""

It was Mr Goh who brought in key third-generation leaders, including Mr George Yeo, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, as well as Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Professor Yaacob Ibrahim and Mr Lim Swee Say. In his speech, PM Lee observed that Mr Goh had assembled ""some of the strongest Cabinets Singapore has had"" at a time when the task of governing Singapore had become more complex.

KINDER AND GENTLER

At home, the Goh years were about renewing the bond between people and government on terms that the second-generation PAP leaders believed in - a kinder, gentler nation, a government that listened, and paid attention not just to material well-being but also matters of the heart, or ""heartware"".

Mr Goh set up the Feedback Unit for Singaporeans to share their views on policies. He launched two national engagement efforts to tap the views and ideas of thousands of Singaporeans - the first in 1997 called Singapore 21, the second in 2001 called Remaking Singapore.

He used budget surpluses to set up endowment funds that to this day provide financial support to less well-off Singaporeans. These range from the Edusave scheme that awards grants and scholarships to students, Medifund which helps poorer Singaporeans foot their healthcare bills, the Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to enhance workers' employability, and Eldercare for those needing nursing homes and other long-term care services.

It was also during Mr Goh's tenure that the Government first started redistributing budget surpluses to citizens in the form of Central Provident Fund top-ups.

At the grassroots level, Mr Goh set up community development councils, inter-racial confidence circles and harmony circles to promote social bonding and cohesion among different racial and religious communities.

He oversaw political innovations such as government parliamentary committees which give backbencher MPs a platform to scrutinise policies, as well as the Nominated MP scheme, which remains a key channel for independent, non-partisan individuals to con-tribute their views in Singapore's Parliament.

Despite his friendly mien and famously dry wit, and his stated goal of nurturing a kinder, gentler Singapore, Mr Goh could be tough in political contests and towards his critics. In 1994, he censured writer Catherine Lim for her article on an ""affective divide"" between the Government and Singaporeans due to its top-down approach to governing. Dr Lim had gone ""beyond the pale"", Mr Goh said, adding that those who wished to comment regularly on politics should enter the political arena.

When it came to electoral battles, Mr Goh fought hard to win, leading the ruling party to victory in three general elections in 1991, 1997 and 2001. The last campaign saw the PAP win 75 per cent of the votes in the midst of an economic crisis due to the fallout of the Sept 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Throughout those years, he stood firm in the face of criticism against the government policy of placing opposition wards last in the queue for HDB estate upgrading.

NO GUARANTEES

Having dedicated his life to serving Singapore, Mr Goh naturally worries about the sustainability of its success.

In recent years, he has voiced concern about the lack of diversity among ministers and the resulting ""groupthink"" that might affect the quality of leadership. His concern stems from the growing share of PAP ministers drawn from the ranks of the public service, including the armed forces. At the same time, he has noted that it is increasingly difficult for the PAP to attract talented people from the private sector into politics.

Another concern is the sustainability of PAP rule - unbroken since 1959.

In 2017, at a dinner to mark his 40 years as MP for Marine Parade, Mr Goh reminded PAP activists not to take voters' support for granted.

The PAP won 56.6 per cent of the votes in Marine Parade GRC in GE2011, on the back of a national slide in the party's vote share, and improved this result with a 64.1 per cent showing in GE2015. But Mr Goh's appeal meant it consistently got a higher percentage of votes in his Marine Parade ward.

""Going forward, we must not assume that we will always poll more than 70 per cent in our Marine Parade ward. We should not even assume that we will always win,"" said Mr Goh.

Younger voters have a ""less instinctive, and more transactional"" bond with the party, he added, compared with the pioneer gene-ration who lived through Singapore's early struggles. As for the opposition, he said he hoped to see one that was ""intelligent, constructive, critical"".

While no longer an MP, Mr Goh has set himself one more political task, and that is to complete the second volume of his biography, entitled Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story.

That at least provides part of the answer to one of the two questions he posed this week. As for the other, ""Quo vadis, Singapore?"" the answer is a work in progress, though the outcome of the upcoming campaign may provide some clues.",0.3438225478225477,0.08356878306878304,Positive

Among those who will not contest the July 10 polls is the country's second prime minister, Mr Goh Chok Tong, who informed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of his decision on Wednesday.

Mr Goh, 79, was an MP for 44 straight years and served as prime minister from 1990 to 2004.

On the other side of the political divide, former Workers' Party (WP) chief Low Thia Khiang bowed out of politics yesterday after 29 years in Parliament, the longest by any opposition MP in Singapore.

WP secretary-general Pritam Singh announced that Mr Low, 63, and two-term MPs Chen Show Mao, 59, and Png Eng Huat, 58, would not be standing in the polls.

The departures come as Singapore gears up for a general election in which leadership transition is a key issue, with the People's Action Party (PAP) fourth-generation leadership set to take the helm.

PM Lee lauded Mr Goh for his calm and steady leadership during crises like the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003.

PM Lee said Mr Goh left his biggest imprint in Marine Parade, where he was first elected in 1976 and re-elected in nine general elections and one by-election.

He added in a Facebook post: ""I am forever personally indebted to Chok Tong, who brought me into politics. Ours was a fruitful comradeship that spanned the entirety of my years in politics and most of his - a close friendship between two prime ministers that would be the envy of many countries.""

In his letter, Mr Goh said many of his activists have urged him to stand for another term. ""But I should not. I would not have the same energy when I cross into my 80s,"" he wrote, adding that smooth and systematic leadership succession is key to Singapore's political stability.

And just as he decided to hand over the reins to PM Lee in 2004, Mr Goh said he prefers to retire now while he is healthy and able, to ease his successor's transition into his Marine Parade ward.

EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY Chok Tong has had an extraordinary political journey. He became MP for Marine Parade at 35, where he has served since 1976! He held multiple portfolios before being asked by his fellow ministers (including me) to be Singapore's second Prime Minister, and he did not let Singapore down. PRIME MINISTER LEE HSIEN LOONG, in a Facebook post.

He assured residents that Marine Parade will be in ""very capable hands"" under Dr Tan See Leng, 55, the former group chief executive and managing director of IHH Healthcare.

Dr Tan was one of 11 new PAP candidates unveiled yesterday, along with former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43. Both men are said to be potential office-holders.

Meanwhile, the WP introduced four candidates, while the Progress Singapore Party unveiled another five candidates, including two retired Singapore Armed Forces officers.

Mr Low, himself, told the media he was stepping down with no regrets as he felt his work was done. ""I have always maintained that a party cannot depend on just an individual or a few individuals,"" he said.

In a Facebook post yesterday, President Halimah Yacob said that although Mr Goh and Mr Low serve on opposite ends of the political spectrum, their mutual respect for each other is well known.

It is thus an ""uncanny coincidence"" that they announced their respective decisions to retire from politics on the same day, she wrote.

She added that Mr Goh - who persuaded her to enter politics 20 years ago - has made tremendous contributions to Singapore, while Mr Low has been a voice of reason among the opposition.

""To many Singaporeans, today's announcements mark the end of an era,"" she said.

Many in single-seat Hougang, where Mr Low, 63, was first elected as MP in 1991 and served the constituency for 20 years, still remember him with great fondness and said it was painful to see him call time on his political career as Singapore longest-serving opposition MP.

Said long-time Hougang resident Andy Teo, 81: ""He's a very good man, I've met him before. He's a very compassionate and straightforward man.""

Added the part-time cleaner: ""I hope he stays on as an adviser to the party. I think the newer group will be missing something without him, so hopefully he will still be able to help them in other ways.""

Mr Mark Ong, 53, who has been living in Hougang Avenue 2 since he was 21, was also disappointed by the news.

But the engineer said that with or without Mr Low, whom he called an ""opposition idol"", he would continue to support the WP.

Mr Ong recalled the time when Mr Low had visited his father's funeral wake and sent the family a wreath of flowers to express his condolences, something the four-term Hougang MP did for bereaved families in his ward.

""A lot of people say Mr Low is an angry man but he is really friendly. He stands up for Singaporeans,"" Mr Ong added.

But many interviewed by The Straits Times also felt that the next generation of WP politicians was ready to step up to the plate.

Administrative officer Ranjit Singh, 56, said he understands the reason for Mr Low retiring from politics, given his age and recent fall.

Said the Hougang resident of seven years: ""He's been around for quite a while. He might be a bit tired. It's also a chance for new blood to come in and have a chance to lead.""

Besides Mr Low, who is an MP for Aljunied GRC, two other of the WP's MPs are also not contesting the July 10 polls.

The duo are Mr Png Eng Huat, 58, who has been Hougang MP since 2012, and Mr Chen Show Mao, 59, an MP for Aljunied GRC.

A 29-year-old resident, who wanted to be known only as Andy, said he was shocked to hear that Mr Png was leaving after just two terms.

But, the technician added: ""It is quite true that the party needs to be renewed. Everything is changing, so it is good to have some younger people come in because different generations have different views.""

Political observers said the changes are not likely to affect WP's chances at the polls.

Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said Hougang is still very much synonymous with Mr Low and as long as his presence is felt there, it is a constituency the WP will win.

""It doesn't really matter if you change the candidates there, so long as they're from WP.""

Dr Mustafa also said the WP has an advantage being the incumbent in Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC and it will bank on that, and the fact that they still have good people to govern the constituencies.

""All of these things are going to matter more than just who is stepping down and who is going to replace them.""

Former nominated MP Zulkifli Baharudin said WP is very much personified by Mr Low and the residents in Hougang and Aljunied resonated with him and his background.

""For people who have voted for him because he speaks their language and is very much their kind of man, it is going to be a lasting influence.""

While it is important for Mr Low to continue to give moral support to the WP and its candidates, all political parties have to go through renewal, Mr Zulkifli said.

""It is a big loss, for sure. But the nature of political parties is such that they must be able to transform.

""As much as the political parties have changed, the electorate also has changed,"" he added.",0.41015444298053017,0.10464939247547943,Positive

The man who helmed the WP for 17 years said on Thursday (June 25) that he decided not to stand in the coming election, as he felt his work was done.

As party chief, he had achieved the twin goals he set for himself after taking over from the party's firebrand leader J. B. Jeyaretnam in 2001.

The first was to secure a group representation constituency for the WP, which he did in 2011.

That year, he famously left his long-time Hougang constituency to lead a team to victory in Aljunied GRC, the first and only time an opposition party had won in a GRC.

The second was to renew the ranks of the WP, and hand over to a new generation of younger leaders. Over the years, he made a concerted effort to attract and field younger members in their 30s and 40s. In 2018, Mr Low stepped down as secretary-general, making way for Mr Pritam Singh, 43.

In his first interview since his retirement from electoral politics was announced, Mr Low told The Straits Times and other media: ""I hope that the Workers' Party itself has that spirit. The whole organisation's formation and process is important, and not just an individual... I have always maintained that a party cannot depend on just an individual or a few individuals.""

It was also the first time that he was speaking to the media after a bad fall at his Upper Thomson home in April left him with traumatic brain injury.

He has since got much better after being discharged from hospital on May 21, and appears none the worse for wear.

But the fall he suffered when on the way to the bathroom left a lasting injury to his olfactory nerve centre, robbing him of his sense of smell and the enjoyment he used to get from a steaming bowl of laksa.

""Laksa has many layers to it, now I can only taste that it is spicy and salty,"" he said, chuckling.

He was quick to add that it was a small price to pay. ""Such a bad fall could have been very very serious, but now I am mostly OK. If I lost my sense of smell, it is a small thing, so be it,"" added Mr Low who has been given medical leave until July 15.

Throughout his political career, the Teochew-speaking businessman can be said to have tasted, in Chinese parlance, ""sourness, sweetness, bitterness and heat"".

His experiences as a student at Nanyang University, which was made to merge with the University of Singapore, and later as a teacher who saw students from poorer backgrounds struggling, left him sour and disillusioned.

It pushed him onto the path of politics, which he felt was the only way to change people's lives.

The WP that he joined in 1982 was more focused on issues like human rights and took a more adversarial approach towards the Government, under Mr Jeyaretnam.

The party then was plagued by the same problems that other opposition parties faced, with infighting and an inability to attract good candidates.

But under Mr Low, who was elected party chief in 2001, it has taken a different direction, focusing on issues of the day and creating a brand of constructive politics that strives to provide a check in Parliament.

In 2011, Mr Low described the WP as a co-driver that would slap the driver, the PAP, if the ruling party were to go off course in governing the country.

His more pragmatic and moderate line has won credibility with the middle ground, gaining the party a broader base of supporters and also a new generation of members with not a few lawyers, bankers and academics.

On this front, he feels that the party has evolved even more with its new, younger leadership.

""Probably they are a different generation in terms of political debates. I would think that I'm more aggressive, but the younger generation like Pritam and Leon, maybe they want a different approach, which I think is not a bad thing,"" he said referring to Mr Singh and Non-Constituency MP Leon Perera.

""If I compare myself with my predecessor Jeyaretnam, I think I am probably mild right? So probably this political progress, where you become less aggressive and you can sit down and talk about things rather than just political brickbats, is a good thing.""

Asked about how he would rate Mr Singh's leadership so far, Mr Low said: ""So far I think Pritam has been good, in that from my observation, (he has) done well in exchanges with the ministers.""

He added that this was true of the party's other MPs as well, as ""they respond appropriately and they make a point although they don't go for some attack here and there like me"".

The sweet taste of victory in Aljunied in 2011 did not last long, and after that general election, the WP's Aljunied-Hougang Town Council got embroiled in a saga over its accounts.

Observers say this contributed to some extent to the WP's more dismal showing in Aljunied in 2015, when they scraped by with 50.96 per cent of votes.

The town council, through an independent panel, successfully sued the party's MPs, including Mr Low, over more than $33 million in improper payments. Mr Low, and party chairman Sylvia Lim were found by the High Court to have breached their fiduciary duties.

In his ruling, the High Court judge said the two Aljunied GRC MPs had acted dishonestly when they awarded a managing agent contract to a company set up by their supporters without calling a tender.

He added that in doing so, they had put their own political interests above the interests of their residents.

Mr Low, along with the other MPs and town councillors, have appealed against the ruling.

Having been an opposition Parliament member for so long, Mr Low has taken some heat from the ruling party. But he is also one of few opposition politicians who have drawn admiration from both sides of the aisle.

On Thursday, asked if the party would lose some of its shine without him contesting, Mr Low, who is Singapore's most successful opposition politician to date, quipped: ""I do not know how many voters vote solely because of me.""

He sought to dismiss the notion that the WP is the ""Low Thia Khiang party"", adding that it has evolved since he was first elected into Parliament and became the party's only representative in the House.

In the past term of Parliament, the WP had a team of six MPs and three NCMPs, and people would judge the party based on their performance and their interactions with voters too, he added.

Asked how he would like his political career to be remembered, Mr Low said: ""I do not have this hope that others will (remember me in any particular way). I have done what I should do, I have no regrets. Of course everyone will have different views. And as a public figure you have to accept them. That's all. I would not be surprised if someone is scolding me; I accept it.

""I will remember the people, the voters. I think these are important life assets, friends in Hougang, I will remember them.""",0.3900208060673177,0.0866780764455183,Positive

The two first-time candidates are research analyst at an investment bank Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, and Mr Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34, a gig-economy worker.

They also introduced two candidates who have stood for election in the past.

One was Ms Nicole Seah, 33, an associate director in a multinational marketing firm who has been volunteering with the WP since 2015. She was a National Solidarity Party candidate in the 2011 election.

The final candidate introduced was education entrepreneur Yee Jenn Jong, 55, who was an NCMP from 2011 to 2015.

In all, the WP will be fielding 21 candidates in six constituencies at the upcoming polls - five in Aljunied, East Coast and Marine Parade GRCs, four in the new Sengkang GRC, and one each for Hougang and Punggol West SMCs.

The party will be introducing more candidates from tomorrow and at the weekend.

Mr Muhammad Azhar Abdul Latip, 34, lost his left leg in a road traffic accident in 2014.

And the experience of having a disability highlighted for him the need for a more inclusive society in Singapore - a cause he hopes to champion if elected to Parliament.

""We want to be an inclusive society, but when it comes to the disabled groups, it tends to be... lip service,"" said Mr Azhar, who was one of two first-time candidates introduced on Thursday by the WP.

Mr Azhar, who has volunteered at food distribution and community outreach programmes in Aljunied GRC, holds a political science degree from the National University of Singapore. He was a marine insurance broker with an international brokerage when the accident occurred. Now he is a Grab driver and small-business owner.

Said Mr Azhar, who is divorced with a child: ""That is one thing I would like to change in society... (I want to help) disabled groups to make sure they are being assisted, that those who want to work are given equal opportunities for employment and receive the help they deserve.""

As an equity research analyst with a global investment bank, Mr Louis Chua Kheng Wee, 33, advises investors on whether they should put money in a particular company.

His work has taught him the value of transparency, disclosure requirements, and the presence of external parties, such as regulators and an independent board of directors, to ensure proper corporate governance.

""It is with this understanding that I strongly believe that a monopoly in government is never a good thing without an effective opposition in Parliament,"" said Mr Chua, one of two new candidates introduced on Thursday by the WP.

Mr Chua has a degree in accountancy from the Singapore Management University and is a qualified chartered accountant.

Building a more resilient society means recognising that dissenting views should not only be accepted but also encouraged, he said.

""This will ensure that we come up with the best ideas to take Singapore forward,"" said Mr Chua, who is married with a nine-month-old son.

He said: ""I really care deeply for the future of Singapore that my son will grow up in.""

WP candidate Nicole Seah, 33, is a familiar face on the campaign trail, having been the star candidate for the National Solidarity Party (NSP) during the 2011 general election. She did not stand in the 2015 general election, but will contest the upcoming polls as a candidate for the WP.

Speaking at a virtual press conference on Thursday, Ms Seah, an associate director at a multinational marketing group, said she recognised that returning to the political scene would mean increased scrutiny.

""To be honest, I'm having a very stable career right now, my personal life is in a very good state,"" she said. ""But I do it for the party, because I believe in the leadership and I believe in the vision, and I do it for my daughter.""

Ms Seah, who is married with a one-year-old daughter, added: ""I want to leave behind a legacy for her where she would feel comfortable regardless of the political inclinations or the kinds of views that she's expressing.""

Ms Seah, who resigned from the NSP in 2014, said she was drawn to the ethos of the WP, which believes in ""building a strong and reasonable opposition that contributes to our political landscape in Singapore in a constructive manner"".

She has been volunteering with the WP since 2015.

Ms Seah said youth employability will be an issue she will champion, noting that some young people are hired on the basis of having more life experience or global exposure.

""This is not available to everyone. And that puts a lot of youth at a disadvantage when they come out into the workforce,"" she said.

We need to make sure that we do our utmost to make them as competitive as possible in a global workforce.""

Mr Yee Jenn Jong, 55, ran and lost to candidates from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) in the 2011 and 2015 general elections.

On July 10, he will stand for the third time as a candidate for the WP because he believes Singapore needs a strong alternative in Parliament.

""Only when there's competition would the PAP listen to you,"" said Mr Yee at a press conference on Thursday. ""In business, we need anti-monopoly laws to keep companies from taking advantage of consumers and to keep on innovating. The same goes for politics as well.""

In 2011, Mr Yee narrowly lost to the PAP's Charles Chong in Joo Chiat SMC, with 48.99 per cent of the vote.

The SMC was absorbed into Marine Parade GRC in 2015, and Mr Yee was fielded as part of WP's slate of five candidates then. The WP garnered 35.9 per cent of votes.

Mr Yee said he continues to be active on the ground, and has initiated community projects in Marine Parade GRC, such as distributing food to lower-income families since the start of the circuit breaker.",0.4160133577841912,0.1027866462241462,Positive

Mr Goh Chok Tong, 79, has been a Member of Parliament for 44 years. He stepped down from Cabinet in 2011 and has been known as Emeritus Senior Minister since then.

Even as he departs the political stage, he has signalled his continued preoccupation with Singapore's future, asking in a cryptic Facebook post on Tuesday (June 23), the day the election was called: ""Parliament dissolved. Quo vadis, Singapore? Quo vadis, me?""

""Quo vadis"" is a Latin phrase commonly translated as ""Where are you going?"" or, more poetically, ""Whither goest thou?""

Mr Goh announced his decision to retire in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (June 24). Mr Lee has accepted his decision and thanked Mr Goh for a lifetime of distinguished service.

Born into a working class family in 1941, Mr Goh worked in the civil service and shipping company Neptune Orient Lines before being inducted into politics in 1976. He rose swiftly to helm several ministries, including Trade and Industry, Health and Defence before being appointed Deputy Prime Minister in 1985. Five years later, he succeeded Mr Lee Kuan Yew as Prime Minister.

Growth and renewal

When he was sworn in as prime minister on Nov 28, 1990, he pledged to make sure ""Singapore thrives and grows after Mr Lee Kuan Yew"".

During his 14 years at the helm, Singapore's per capita gross domestic product grew from $21,950 in 1990 to more than $38,000 in 2004. A web of free trade agreements (FTAs), including with major economies like the US and Japan, expanded the island nation's political and economic space overseas.

Mr Goh played a key role in regional integration, working to narrow the development gap between the original Asean five and the newer member states of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam. This was done through the Initiative for Asean Integration (IAI) launched in 2000.

He sparked off an ""India fever"" in Singapore in the 1990s, making multiple trips to the country, urging it to forge closer ties with the region, and pushing for the conclusion of the India - Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca).

He also led Singapore's efforts to grow links between world regions through the Asia-Europe Meeting, the Forum for East Asia-Latin America Cooperation, and Asia-Middle East Dialogue. These cemented Singapore's cultural, economic and political relevance to the world.

As prime minister, it also fell to him to secure a team to succeed himself and his peers in Cabinet.

During his tenure as Minister for Defence, Mr Goh talent spotted a young Lee Hsien Loong, then a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) leader, and persuaded him to enter politics and stand for election in 1984.

Prime Minister Lee himself spoke of Mr Goh's ability to get capable people to join his team and work for him, when he launched the latter's biography Tall Order in 2018.

Mr Lee said of his predecessor: ""He nurtures and holds the team together. He considers and takes in their views, and gets the best out of the team.""

It was Mr Goh who brought in key third-generation leaders, including Mr George Yeo, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, as well as Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim and Mr Lim Swee Say. In his speech, PM Lee observed that Mr Goh had assembled ""some of the strongest Cabinets Singapore has had"" at a time when the task of governing Singapore had become more complex.

Kinder and gentler

At home, the Goh years were about renewing the bond between people and government on terms that the second generation PAP leaders believed in - a kinder, gentler nation, a government that listened and paid attention not just to material well-being but also matters of the heart, or ""heartware"".

Mr Goh set up the Feedback Unit for Singaporeans to share their views on policies. He launched two national engagement efforts to tap the views and ideas of thousands of Singaporeans - the first in 1997 called Singapore 21, the second in 2001 called Remaking Singapore.

He used budget surpluses to set up endowment funds that to this day provide financial support to less well-off Singaporeans. These range from the Edusave scheme that awards grants and scholarships to students, Medifund which helps poorer Singaporeans foot their healthcare bills, Lifelong Learning Endowment Fund to enhance workers' employability, and Eldercare for those needing nursing homes and other long-term care services.

It was also during Mr Goh's tenure that the Government first started redistributing budget surpluses to citizens in the form of Central Provident Fund (CPF) top-ups.

At the grassroots level, Mr Goh set up community development councils, Inter-Racial Confidence Circles and Harmony Circles to promote social bonding and cohesion among different racial and religious communities.

He oversaw political innovations such as government parliamentary committees which give backbencher MPs a platform to scrutinise policies, as well as the Nominated MP scheme, which remains a key channel for independent, non-partisan individuals to contribute their views in Singapore's Parliament.

Despite his stated goal of nurturing a kinder, gentler Singapore, Mr Goh could be tough in political contests and towards his critics. In 1994, he censured writer Catherine Lim for her article on an ""affective divide"" between the Government and Singaporeans due to its top-down approach to governing. Dr Lim had gone ""beyond the pale"", Mr Goh said, adding that those who wished to comment regularly on politics should enter the political arena.

When it came to electoral battles, Mr Goh fought hard to win, leading the ruling party to victory in three general elections in 1991, 1997 and 2001. The last campaign saw the PAP win 75 per cent of the votes in the midst of an economic crisis due to the fallout of the Sept 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Throughout those years, he stood firm in the face of criticism against the government policy of placing opposition wards last in the queue for HDB estate upgrading.

No guarantees

Having dedicated his life to serving Singapore, Mr Goh naturally worries about the sustainability of its success.

In recent years, he has voiced concern about the lack of diversity among ministers and the resulting ""groupthink"" that might affect the quality of leadership. His concern stems from the growing share of PAP ministers drawn from the ranks of the public service, including the armed forces. At the same time, he has noted that it is increasingly difficult for the PAP to attract talented people from the private sector into politics.

Another concern is the sustainablity of PAP rule - unbroken since 1959.

In 2017, at a dinner to mark his 40 years as MP for Marine Parade, Mr Goh reminded PAP activists not to take voters' support for granted.

The PAP won 56.6 per cent of the votes in Marine Parade GRC in GE2011, on the back of a national slide in the party's vote share, and improved this result with a 64.1 per cent showing in GE2015. But Mr Goh's appeal meant it consistently got a higher percentage of votes in his Marine Parade ward.

""Going forward, we must not assume that we will always poll more than 70 per cent in our Marine Parade ward. We should not even assume that we will always win,"" said Mr Goh.

Younger voters have a ""less instinctive, and more transactional"" bond with the party, he added, compared with the Pioneer Generation who lived through Singapore's early struggles. As for the opposition, he said he hoped to see one that was ""intelligent, constructive, critical"".

While no longer an MP, Mr Goh has set himself one more political task, and that is to complete the second volume of his biography, entitled Tall Order: The Goh Chok Tong Story.

That at least provides part of the answer to one of the two questions he posed this week. As for the other, ""Quo vadis, Singapore?"", the answer is a work in progress, though the outcome of the upcoming campaign may provide some clues.",0.33590871562300134,0.08335336356764926,Positive

ESM Goh's letter to PM Lee:

24 June 2020

Mr Lee Hsien Loong

Prime Minister, Republic of Singapore

Secretary-General, People's Action Party

Dear Prime Minister,

As Parliament has now been dissolved, I write to inform you that I have decided not to stand in the coming General Elections. Having served as a Member of Parliament for Marine Parade for over four decades, I make this decision after much thought and with a heavy heart.

Marine Parade is my second home. I love the people. The PAP Branch activists and the grassroots leaders are my steadfast comrades and firm friends. Many have urged me to stand for another term. But I should not. I would not have the same energy when I cross into my 80s.

Smooth and systematic leadership succession is the key to Singapore's political stability. I decided to step down as PM in 2004 after the economy had recovered from Sars and when you were in place to take over as my successor. Similarly, I prefer to retire as Member of Parliament now whilst I am healthy and able to ease my successor's transition into Marine Parade.

Dr Tan See Leng has been understudying me for nearly two years now. He helps me with my Meet-the-People Sessions, and with several social projects that I initiated in the constituency. He is now operationalising our Caregiver Support Network, an important new initiative for a mature estate like Marine Parade. He has also played an active role in EduGrow, our youth mentorship programme for students from lower-income families. See Leng connects well with residents, Branch members and grassroots leaders alike. He has held dialogues with residents and gone on house visits until Covid-19 put a stop to them. I recommend him to take over from me.

Competent and trusted leaders with the heart for public service are critical to protect and advance Singaporeans' interests. We need more lion-hearted people to secure Singapore's place in an increasingly turbulent world.

I strongly support your planned leadership succession at the national level. The 4G team led by Heng Swee Keat has been tested and strengthened in the crucible of Covid-19. We must look for more good men and women to join the team.

Likewise, we should start building up the core of the 5G team.

I hope you will accept my decision to step down as Member of Parliament.

It has been my greatest honour and privilege to have served the Party, residents of Marine Parade, Singapore and Singaporeans for the past 44 years.

I will continue to contribute to Singapore in other ways.

Best wishes for a successful General Election ahead.

PM Lee's reply to ESM Goh:

25 June 2020

Mr Goh Chok Tong

Emeritus Senior Minister

Prime Minister's Office

Singapore

Dear Chok Tong,

Thank you for your letter of 24 June 2020. With sadness, I accept your decision to retire from politics at the forthcoming General Election.

Singapore is going through a difficult time because of Covid-19. But we have experienced crises before, including when you were Prime Minister, such as the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-98, the September 2001 terrorist attacks, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. On those occasions, your calm and steady leadership gave Singaporeans comfort and courage. Those crises were painful experiences that left their mark on us, but they strengthened us too. This gives us confidence that this time with Covid-19, we will again emerge stronger.

Your contributions continued after you stepped down as PM. In Parliament, you weighed in during key debates, including on integrated resorts and ministerial salaries. You guided the younger MPs, providing them with historical perspective, and inculcating in them the values and ethic of public service. You also served as Chairman and remain Senior Adviser of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, guiding MAS to enhance the resilience of the banking system, strengthen links with international partners, promote innovation, and protect retail consumers.

Internationally, you built bridges for our people, opened doors for our businesses, and flew our flag high. When Myanmar opened up in 2011, your personal relationship with their leaders gave our companies an entry to seize the economic opportunities there. You initiated the Tianjin Eco-City and Guangzhou Knowledge City, creating new platforms for Singapore to collaborate with China. In India, without the trust and goodwill you built up over many years, I could not have signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca) in 2005.

It is in Marine Parade that you have left the most personal imprint on the lives of individual Singaporeans. You were returned as the MP for Marine Parade eleven times, in ten general elections and one by-election over almost 45 years. When you were first elected in 1976, Marine Parade was newly reclaimed land - a large but blank canvas on which our hopes and dreams could be projected. Today, those dreams have become reality. Marine Parade has become a vibrant waterfront town filled with warmth, which people of all ages are proud to call home. The story of Marine Parade is the story of Singapore - out of nothing, we created something special. You made that happen.

In the process, you built lifelong friendships with your grassroots leaders, and an unbreakable bond with your residents. They know that you always have their welfare at heart. In the early days you proposed setting up Residents' Committees (RCS) in Marine Parade to build communities in our neighbourhoods and precincts. The project succeeded, and today we have replicated that structure island-wide with more than 800 RCs and Neighbourhood Committees.

After leaving the Cabinet, you devoted even more time and energy to your constituency. Residents from other parts of the GRC would often meet you at Meet-the-People Sessions, as you joined your fellow MPs to help residents in their branches. You raised funds to start numerous social programmes, including the Marine Parade Leadership Foundation to train future community leaders, WeCare @ MarineParade to help vulnerable residents, and EduGrow for kindergarten and primary school students from disadvantaged family backgrounds. These projects inspired national programmes like the Youth Corps Singapore, the SG Cares Community Network, and the UPLIFT programme which MOE is now rolling out across Singapore. You also founded the Mediacorp Enable Fund to help persons with disabilities fulfil their aspirations.

Grassroots leaders and residents in Marine Parade will miss you. But like me, they understand and respect your decision to retire, because they have seen you advocate and uphold the principle of leadership renewal all your life. As PAP Secretary-General, you were tireless in bringing in fresh blood to the party. In 2004 when you relinquished the Prime Ministership, and in 2011 when you left the Cabinet, you still had much more to give. But you decided that it was in the party's interest, and especially in the national interest, to let someone younger take over.

I will always be personally indebted to you. You brought me into politics and have guided and mentored me all these years. It was my privilege to be your deputy throughout your premiership. After you retired from Cabinet, we continued with our regular lunches. I always looked forward to these opportunities to share my thoughts and concerns candidly with someone who fully understood what was at stake, and to hear your reactions and perspectives. Your advice, based on a lifetime of experience, helped me clarify my thoughts and avoid many unnecessary errors. Ours was a fruitful comradeship that spanned the entirety of my years in politics and most of yours - a close relationship between two prime ministers that would be the envy of many countries.

In the PAP Marine Parade Branch, I am glad the succession is well in hand, and Dr Tan See Leng will be taking over as Branch Chairman. I am also glad that you will maintain your links with Marine Parade, as Chairman Emeritus of the Marine Parade Branch and Adviser Emeritus to Marine Parade GROs. At the national level you have agreed to be appointed Senior Adviser to the People's Association on a pro bono basis. I am happy that you will continue to chair the Governing Board of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. This will enable you to continue to contribute the insights and experience you have accumulated all these years.

On behalf of all Singaporeans, I thank you for a lifetime of distinguished service. You have given your all and more in the service of your country and people. I wish you and Mrs Goh a long, healthy and happy retirement.

Yours sincerely,

SingFirst secretary-general Tan Jee Say on Thursday (June 25) announced on Facebook that the party's central executive committee had decided to dissolve the party as it believes a strong opposition is best achieved with consolidation.

""This decision was not made lightly, but we believe that this move is in the best interests of Singapore,"" he said in the statement.

Mr Tan, a former member of the Singapore Democratic Party, founded SingFirst in 2014. The party fielded 10 candidates in the 2015 General Election and contested Tanjong Pagar and Jurong GRCs but did not win any seats.

On Thursday, Mr Tan said his party had worked hard with other opposition parties in recent months to foster greater unity and cooperation.

He added that the party had also directed a number of potential members to join other parties instead, and that some of its former members are now active in the other parties.

The statement also encouraged current SingFirst members to join parties that reflect their values and beliefs and help those parties in the coming election.

Dr Ang Yong Guan, SingFirst’s former chairman, has joined the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) helmed by Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

Dr Ang, who previously headed the psychological medicine branch in the Singapore Armed Forces, was named as a PSP candidate for this election.

Mr Melvyn Chiu, who was also from SingFirst, has joined the Singapore People’s Party (SPP). He will be contesting Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC in the upcoming election on SPP’s ticket.

Both Dr Ang and Mr Chiu were part of SingFirst’s Tanjong Pagar GRC team in the 2015 General Election, where they garnered 22.29 per cent of the votes.

In his statement, Mr Tan thanked Singaporeans for their support.

“It has been an honour and privilege to advocate on Singaporeans’ behalf and we hope to continue to have your support wherever we go.”

Party chairman Andy Zhu told The Straits Times that Mr Jeyaretnam has written to the authorities.

""The information that I have is that he has asked the relevant (authorities) for a shorter SHN,"" said Mr Zhu, who led several RP members on a walkabout in Ang Mo Kio GRC on Thursday.

Singapore residents returning from overseas have to serve a 14-day SHN in a designated facility.

They can serve the SHN at home if they had spent 14 days prior in one of a handful of countries, including Australia and Taiwan.

However, Britain is not on the list and Mr Zhu said Mr Jeyaretnam was in England to visit his son, who studies there.

Nomination Day is on June 30 and Polling day is on July 10. Mr Jeyaretnam, 61, would not have completed his 14-day SHN by Nomination Day and would only have done so on Cooling-Off Day.

But a potential candidate can authorise a representative to submit the nomination papers on Nomination Day, if unwell and certified by a medical practitioner to be unfit, the Elections Department had announced earlier.

The Elections Department and the Ministry of Health said on Wednesday night it was unable to waive Mr Jeyaretnam's SHN requirements.

""The Ministry of Health (MOH) has assessed Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam’s request for a waiver of the Stay-Home Notice (SHN) upon his return from the United Kingdom. For public health reasons, MOH is unable to accede to the request. Mr Jeyaretnam is therefore required to complete a 14-day SHN at a designated SHN facility, and undertake a Covid-19 test before the end of his SHN, similar to all other Singaporeans returning from the United Kingdom,"" the ELD and MOH said.

The statement added that the MOH is prepared to grant Mr Jeyaratnam ""access to the persons required in order for him to issue the Power of Attorney, as well as to make his statutory declaration that the statements made in his nomination papers are true"".

The SHN requirements mean the RP chief will not be able to participate in his party's walkabout or home visits.

On Thursday, potential RP candidates turned up at the Ang Mo Kio Central Market to hand out fliers and speak to residents.

Mr Zhu, 37, was there with three other candidates - Ms Noraini Yunos, 52; Mr Charles Yeo, 30; and Mr Mahaboob Batcha, 52.

The party chairman said RP has worked the ground in the five-person Ang Mo Kio GRC since 2011.

""We have been through two contests in Ang Mo Kio and we believe it is not about the candidates who are coming back to serve (but) the party that is still around to serve Singaporeans,"" he told The Straits Times.

The People's Action Party (PAP) team won in 2011 with 69.33 per cent of the votes and 78.63 per cent of the ballots in 2015.

The team was led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in both elections.

The party has won in every general election there since the GRC's formation in 1991.

In addition to Ang Mo Kio GRC, Mr Zhu said RP intends to field candidates in the single-seat wards of Radin Mas and Yio Chu Kang.

RP will not be back in West Coast GRC, where it contested unsuccessfully in 2011 and 2015.

In a Facebook post on June 23, Mr Jeyaretnam ruled out the GRC, saying it was to avoid a potential three-cornered fight with the PAP and the Progress Singapore Party.",0.4510802469135803,0.0032407407407407415,Positive

Mr Goh, who was prime minister from 1990 to 2004, announced his decision in a letter to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (June 24) and PM Lee has accepted his decision to retire from politics.

In his reply on Thursday (June 25), PM Lee thanked Mr Goh for a lifetime of distinguished service, on behalf of all Singaporeans.

The exchange of letters was released by the Prime Minister's Office on Thursday.

Mr Goh said it has been his greatest honour and privilege to have served the People's Action Party, residents of Marine Parade, as well as Singapore and Singaporeans over the past 44 years. He added that he will continue to contribute in other ways.

In a Facebook post on Thursday afternoon, Mr Goh said: ""Residents, party comrades and grassroots leaders have urged me to stand once more in the coming GE. It is with a heavy heart that I have decided not to. Although I am still healthy, I worry I will not have the same energy to serve after I become an octogenarian next year (sounds old, doesn't it?). It will not be fair to you.""

Mr Goh assured residents that Marine Parade will be in ""very capable hands"" under his successor in the constituency, Dr Tan See Leng.

Mr Goh said Dr Tan, 55, who has been understudying him for two years, has the ""right character, temperament, motivations, values and competence to be your next MP"". Dr Tan will succeed Mr Goh as PAP Marine Parade Branch chairman.

In his reply to Mr Goh's letter, PM Lee said he is glad Mr Goh's succession is well in hand. Said PM Lee: ""It is in Marine Parade that you have left the most personal imprint on the lives of individual Singaporeans.

PM Lee acknowledged how Mr Goh had continued to contribute to Singapore's growth after he stepped down as PM - from inculcating the values and ethics of public service in younger MPs to guiding the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to enhance the resilience of the banking system, strengthen links with international partners, promote innovation, and protect retail consumers.

PM Lee also recognised Mr Goh's efforts in building good relationships with foreign leaders which in turn created opportunities for Singapore businesses.

In a Facebook post on Thursday, PM Lee added: ""I am forever personally indebted to Chok Tong, who brought me into politics. Ours was a fruitful comradeship that spanned the entirety of my years in politics and most of his - a close friendship between two prime ministers that would be the envy of many countries.""

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, in a Facebook post, recalled how Mr Goh had given him very valuable advice during the Global Financial Crisis in 2008, when he was deliberating hard on whether to seek approval from the President for a $150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits in Singapore, to be backed by past reserves.

Mr Heng was then the managing director of MAS and Mr Goh its chairman.

""I was glad to have the wise counsel of ESM Goh. He taught us that we must face difficult decisions head-on. Having thought through the options, we must have the courage to do what is right. It was a lesson that stayed with me and continues to guide much of my work,"" wrote Mr Heng.

In a Facebook post, Speaker of the 13th Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin thanked Mr Goh for being a great mentor, describing him as a ""down-to-earth person with a mischievous sense of humour"" who looks out for those around him and his residents.

Mr Goh, an economist by training, joined the Government's Administrative Service in 1964 and joined national shipping company Neptune Orient Lines in 1969, becoming its managing director from 1973 to 1977.

He entered politics in 1976 and was first elected to Parliament as MP for Marine Parade in the 1976 general election.

He was re-elected in nine subsequent general elections, and served as Minister for Trade and Industry, Health and Defence between 1979 and 1990. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in 1985, and succeeded Mr Lee Kuan Yew as Singapore's prime minister in November 1990.

Mr Goh relinquished the post of PM in August 2004 to Mr Lee Hsien Loong, and remained in the Cabinet as Senior Minister. He also served as chairman of MAS from 2004 to 2011.

He stepped down from Cabinet alongside Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew after the 2011 general election, and was given the honorary title of Emeritus Senior Minister.

He was also appointed Senior Advisor to MAS.

His successor in Marine Parade, Dr Tan, was introduced as a PAP candidate for the July 10 general election on Thursday morning by Mr Heng.

This was the third round of candidate introductions from the party and brings the total number of candidates it has unveiled so far to 17.

The party, led by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, has said it will be contesting 24 seats in nine constituencies in the coming election.

The two military men introduced are PSP organising secretary Michael Chua, 55, who has been spotted at party activities at Tanjong Pagar GRC, and Mr Nadarajah Loganathan, 57, the co-founder of a skills training firm, who is expected to be on the party's A-team in West Coast GRC.

Mr Chua was an SAF Merit Scholarship recipient in 1985. He left active service in 2002 and continued doing National Service as a Deputy Brigade Commander until 2016. Mr Loganathan retired from the military in 2009 as a Lieutenant Colonel.

The other three candidates unveiled were: Lawyer Wendy Low, 43, who is also believed to be in the Tanjong Pagar GRC team; customer service manager Damien Tay, 51, who has been seen on walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC; and Mr Kumaran Pillai, 57, former publisher of the website The Independent Singapore, who confirmed that he will be running in the newly carved out Kebun Baru SMC.

PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock, 80, said during the press conference that the five are ordinary people who just want to step forward and serve the country, and who subscribe to his message that ""Singapore should change for the better"".

""They represent a spread of talent from all walks of life. Some may be more specialised, some may be just bringing their working experience to share with us, and also some of their involvement in NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and the private sector, and also some of them have worked before in the government sector,"" he said.

""I think they will bring along with them a lot of such experiences from all different sectors of our community and of our country.""

Asked about how age factored into his choice of candidates given the five today were all in their 40s and 50s, Dr Tan said that age was not a consideration.

""This country belongs to all of us, young and old,"" he said. ""Don't worry about age. I started my computer learning at 70. And then I'm now learning about all these Zoom and so on, it's so fun.""

MICHAEL CHUA, 55, RUNS A PRIVATE FIRM IN ENVIRONMENTAL SECTOR

Mr Chua is the organising secretary of the PSP, and one of its 12 founding members. He has been involved in party activities in the Tanjong Pagar GRC.

“I believe that I have no right to urge others to step forward, if I myself am not willing to take the plunge. I must have skin in the game. I must be at the forefront to share how we can do better.”

Mr Chua was a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Merit Scholarship recipient in 1985. He left active service in 2002 as a Major and moved to the private sector, but continued doing National Service as a Deputy Brigade Commander until 2016.

“These experiences... shaped my thinking on how we can tackle the challenges the country faces, particularly the systemic problems that exist as a result of the structural deficiencies from an ever more rigid bureaucracy.”

NADARAJAH LOGANATHAN, 57, CO-FOUNDER OF A SKILLS-TRAINING FIRM

The former military officer is expected to be on the party’s A-team in West Coast GRC.

Mr Loganathan served in the SAF for 25 years, retiring in February 2009 as a lieutenant-colonel. He went on to start a skills-training firm.

He said he will focus on education policies and push for Singaporeans to be placed first in all job opportunities.

Mr Loganathan has been volunteering with the Hindu Endowment Board since 2016, leading a team of volunteers to manage the crowds during Thaipusam.

He was also actively involved in the Indian Activities and Educational Committee in Limbang Community Club from 2015, until he joined the PSP in January last year.

“I’ve settled my family. My three girls are all graduating or going to graduate very soon. And so I will look at how to then help the country,” said Mr Loganathan.

KUMARAN PILLAI, 49, RUNS A CONSULTANCY TO DEVELOP START-UPS

The former publisher of the website The Independent Singapore, confirmed that he will be running in the new single-seat ward of Kebun Baru.

“I guess the cat is out of the bag for Kebun Baru. I’ve been walking the ground there. I’ve been doing my walkabouts at the Mayflower Market and in Sembawang Hills.”

Mr Kumaran left his post at the website in February this year after he entered politics.

He has been active in the start-up scene, running an incubator backed by Spring Singapore to launch about 28 local start-ups.

Mr Kumaran said an excessive focus on the economy has seen many in society left behind by government policies.

He said that after commenting and writing about politics for close to seven years, he was convinced by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, the party’s secretary-general, that it is not enough and he needs to take the fight into Parliament.

WENDY LOW, 43, LAWYER

Ms Low was a partner at Rajah and Tan from 2008 to 2017, and currently leads the Intellectual Property advisory and dispute practice of Eldan Law LLP.

She has been spotted in party walkabouts in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

She has advocated for women’s issues with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Hong Kong and Singapore, including in the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware).

M Low has also been volunteering with Justice Without Borders, a cross-border NGO providing pro bono legal help to domestic workers in Singapore who have been abused or unfairly treated at work.

She said she has a passion for looking at issues of deep inequality, and wants to change the common mindset here that NGOs are “just trying to be difficult”. Instead, Ms Low said they can drive long-term positive changes for people impacted by certain issues, and help the government make better policies too.

She also hopes to preserve local art, culture and heritage, and leverage on technology to let women and freelancers gain meaningful home-based employment.

DAMIEN TAY, 51, CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER

Mr Tay has three decades of commercial operations experience in multinational corporations in the electronics, retail and medical industries. He has been spotted in party walkabouts in Nee Soon GRC.

Currently a customer service manager, Mr Tay has three broad areas which he wishes to effect change in.

Firstly, he wants better job opportunities for Singaporeans, in light of the disproportionate number of foreigners in Singapore’s workforce due to globalisation.

He also wants to bridge the inequality gap for a more equitable and proportionate distribution of wealth.

Mr Tay also wants to focus on addressing the impact of climate change here.",0.38192128047391205,0.052011847801321495,Positive

Asked why the WP was contesting fewer seats this time - 21 compared with 28 in 2015, Mr Singh said the WP has fielded the best candidates that the party could find.

""We want them to represent Singapore, and to represent (Singaporeans) well,"" he said.

""Of course, we can consider fielding more seats,"" he said, but added: ""It's important to focus our efforts and ensure that the candidates that we put forward can do well for the Workers' Party.""

The latest batch of PAP candidates unveiled on Thursday (June 25) brings with them years of experience in community and volunteer work, on top of time spent in the civil service or corporate world.

For instance, Ms Yeo Wan Ling, who used to work for the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), helps match caregivers to those who need one through a social enterprise.

Mr Alvin Tan is a long-time grassroots volunteer who works for tech giant LinkedIn.

He has been helping the elderly and young acquire digital skills amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

Polytechnic lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah defied convention by going from the Normal stream to obtaining a PhD. He has been active for many years in inter-religious circles.

Former civil servant Eric Chua, who came from humble beginnings, has been working with young people for more than a decade. He won a scholarship from the Public Service Commission and rose up the ranks in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF).

Speaking at a virtual press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road, PAP vice-chairman Masagos Zulkifli said the new candidates have gone through ""varied and interesting journeys"" in their lives.

At another virtual press conference on Thursday, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, who is also the PAP’s organising secretary, introduced three other new faces, who are all from the private sector.

With these introductions, the PAP has so far unveiled 19 of the 26 new faces it is expected to field in the July 10 election.

Here are the seven PAP candidates introduced by Mr Masagos and Ms Fu:

Ms Yeo Wan Ling, 44, chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia

Ms Yeo was part of the global operations team at the EDB. She now runs Caregiver Asia, a social enterprise that connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers in Singapore. She said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly in Singapore to continue to work or contribute to the community.

Ms Yeo said one of the most meaningful things at EDB was “being able to work on projects that created and brought in very good and meaningful jobs for all Singaporeans”. She added that she started her social enterprise, as she saw a gap in the provision of home-care services, in particular long-term care for the elderly.

On why she left the civil service to start her own venture, she said: “My grandmother... was ill for a number of years before she passed on. And it was spending her twilight years together with me that I realised the importance of being able to grow old with grace and dignity.”

Ms Yeo said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly to continue to work or contribute to the community, and wants to champion caregiving programmes.

Ms Yeo, who is married, said: “Politics allows me to bring together the type of experiences I have with the civil service, and working in the community... and to be able to influence not just day-to-day operations of helping people, but also to bring it up to a larger platform such that I can (have an impact on) national policies.”

Mr Alvin Tan Sheng Hui, 39, Head of Public Policy and Economics at LinkedIn

Mr Tan has been a grassroots volunteer since 2005, working together with Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo in Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said he faced obstacles in his education journey – he was once held back a grade, and did not do well enough to enter a local university.

Despite the earlier setbacks, he earned a Bachelor of Economics with First Class Honours from Sydney University, and later, a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University. He has worked at the Ministry of Defence, the United Nations and non-profit group Oxfam, as well as in investment banking. He is now in the technology sector - earlier at social media giant Facebook and now at social networking platform LinkedIn.

Mr Tan said he hopes to use his skills and experience in the public, private and non-profit sectors to help Singaporeans become more nimble and prepared for the future of work.

He said he also aims to bridge the digital divide for seniors and other vulnerable groups, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic has hastened the need for all Singaporeans to acquire such digital skills. Work is now being done to help these groups, and more needs to be done, he said.

Said Mr Tan: “By the time Covid-19 is over... if we (still) haven’t become comfortable with technology, I think we might have failed our people.

“And so I will continue to really tirelessly advocate, and go to the ground and help all our students, stallholders... prepare for the future of work that has come much sooner than any of us has expected.”

Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 42, senior lecturer at Republic Polytechnic

Dr Wan Rizal, who is married with four children, started volunteering in the community in 2010. He was chairman of Al-Islah mosque in Punggol, and was also part of Punggol's Interracial and Religious Confidence Circle.

He was a student in the Normal (Academic) stream before obtaining a polytechnic diploma and enrolling in the National Institute of Education and later Nanyang Technological University, where he obtained his degree in physical education at the age of 31.

He said: “I hope to be the voice in Parliament that upholds social mobility. Because of the non-linear path that I had taken, I strongly believe that education is the key to social mobility. This is how we can allow people who have less, or did less well to move up and prevent our society from being stratified.

“Singapore must continue to be a nation of opportunities for all, not for just the privileged few, or the lucky ones, but for every Singaporean.”

Singapore’s education system is on the right track, he said. He added that he hopes to be part of its further development. For instance, he said he sees the value of early childhood education, and the importance of providing multiple pathways for Singaporeans to continue developing their skills.

He also hopes to advocate for the sandwiched class, as well as those who may face difficulties juggling work and family life.

Mr Eric Chua Swee Leong, 41, former director of the SGSecure Programme Office

Mr Chua grew up in a three-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. His father was a forklift driver and his mother was a seamstress.

He was awarded the Local Merit Scholarship (Civil Defence) by the Public Service Commission to read communications studies at Nanyang Technological University. He served with the SCDF, eventually becoming commander of the 3rd SCDF Division.

Most recently, he was director of the SGSecure Programme Office in Ministry of Home Affairs.

Mr Chua, whose baby boy is eight days old, has spent 15 years doing community work with young people. He said he finds joy and satisfaction in mentoring young people and seeing them find success in life.

He added that he hopes to continue his work with the young and to hear their concerns on issues such as social mobility and income inequality.

MR RAYMOND LYE HOONG YIP, 54, MANAGING PARTNER AT UNION LAW LLP

Mr Lye, a father of three, has been volunteering for 25 years.

When introducing himself, he recounted how he and other volunteers helped a low-income resident deal with a problem.

Mr Lye, who chairs the Punggol East Citizens’ Consultative Committee, said the resident’s daughter had obtained a scholarship from an unnamed agency that allowed her to enter university despite her family’s finances.

But the agency later asked the resident to cough up a large sum of money, as her daughter’s grades were not good.

Mr Lye said that after several attempts, he and other volunteers managed to get the agency to write off the sum and the family was able to save up enough money to buy their own flat and move out of the rental block.

Despite having volunteered for groups like clan societies and trade associations, Mr Lye said that he finds community work most fulfilling. “Most satisfying for me is community work, where I get to listen to residents in their homes, their void decks and the coffee shops,” said Mr Lye, who has been volunteering in the new Sengkang GRC.

“I have always tried my best to help, as no government policy is foolproof and there are those who may fall through the cracks.”

MS POH LI SAN, 44, VICE-PRESIDENT FOR TERMINAL 5 PLANNING AT CHANGI AIRPORT GROUP

Sembawang is a special place for Ms Poh, a former helicopter pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the first woman to be appointed full-time aide-de-camp to the late President S R Nathan.

She spent a lot time in Sembawang when she was based at Sembawang Air Base for the RSAF.

“Sembawang is really a very special place for me, plenty of fond memories. And now that I have a chance to go back to Sembawang to serve on the ground, I’m really excited to work closely with our volunteers with our residents there,” said Ms Poh, who started volunteering in grassroots activities and Meet-the-People sessions in Sembawang GRC in 2018.

Ms Poh, who is single, started an annual Women Festival for the constituency and also took part in distributing food to rental flat residents.

She is tipped to join the PAP team that will contest Sembawang GRC, which will likely lose Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan as he is expected to retire from politics soon.

MR DERRICK GOH SOON HEE, 51, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND HEAD OF GROUP AUDIT AT DBS BANK

Before taking up his position at DBS, Mr Goh headed its subsidary POSB, where he said he was exposed to volunteering efforts by community leaders and grassroots.

This inspired the father of three to take up community work.

Mr Goh spent more than 10 years at credit firm American Express, based in London and New York. He intends to use his experience from the international banking sector to help improve the lives of Singaporeans.

“I want to play a part to improve the system, to hone the system. And I know that Singapore is not perfect, but having lived in all these international financial centres, I can say personally that Singapore is the best,” he said.

“And therefore, I want to play a role to help Singapore adapt as the world changes very rapidly, given digitisation and the onset of the impact of new technology.”

Since 2013, Mr Goh has ben volunteering as a district councillor with the South West Community Development Council and also serves on the board of HomeTeamNS.

Mr Goh, who is vice-chairman of the Gambas-Yishun Citizens’ Consultative Committee, has been seen with Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam at community engagements in Nee Soon, where he is expected to be fielded.

The line-up this time included former high-ranking civil and public servants, namely former Community Chest managing director Ng Ling Ling and former Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) chief executive Tan Kiat How.

The youngest was lawyer Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, 39, and the oldest was former Parkway Holdings group chief executive, Dr Tan See Leng, 55.

In a virtual press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, said these four candidates had modest upbringings.

“But Singapore’s conditions of education and providing opportunities enabled them to be at their best to be able to achieve what they set out to do,” added Mr Heng, who is the PAP’s first assistant secretary-general.

“Creating these conditions remains a very critical factor I think we must continue if we want Singapore to continue to progress.”

This group is the most senior crop of candidates introduced so far, with Dr Tan succeeding Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong as chairman of the PAP Marine Parade branch.



DR TAN SEE LENG, 55, former Parkway Holdings group chief executive

Dr Tan, who has spent more than 30 years in the medical sector, is the oldest PAP candidate introduced so far. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post on Thursday that he was glad that Mr Goh had found in Dr Tan a successor as branch chairman.

Dr Tan said he had spent two years under Mr Goh’s tutelage and worked with him on a caregiver support network for the elderly that will be launched after the election, but declined to comment on where he will be fielded.

The father of three grew up in a Toa Payoh rental flat and is a family physician by training.

He said the deaths of his parents from cancer in the 2000s had strengthened his resolve to get a master’s in family medicine, followed by a Master of Business Administration.

Currently a corporate adviser to Temasek Holdings and adviser to DBS Bank, he is also an independent director of Surbana Jurong and was the former group chief executive officer and managing director of healthcare group IHH Healthcare Berhad.

TAN KIAT HOW, 43, former IMDA chief executive

Mr Tan, a public servant for nearly 20 years, was part of the team that set up the Pioneer Generation Office– now known as the Silver Generation Office – and was responsible for mobilising 3,000 volunteers to do outreach to nearly half a million seniors.

He took up the top post at IMDA in 2017. Under his leadership, the organisation took steps to build up Singapore’s connectivity infrastructure, such as the rollout of the country’s fourth telco.

Previously, he was deputy secretary for cyber and technology at the Ministry of Communications and Information, where he worked on Singapore’s national cyber security strategy.

Digitalisation is an issue close to his heart, he said.

“Helping workers, businesses to use technology to create more opportunities and for a better life is making sure that no one is left behind in a digital future.”

NG LING LING, 48, former managing director of Community Chest

Ms Ng, who spent six years in banking before moving to social and public services, said she has been working on innovating new care models, such as using simple technology to help people with high blood pressure understand the disease and guard against strokes.

Related Story GE2020: Live coverage on Singapore General Election

“I see the importance of long-term holistic care, as our population ages rapidly, to consider both the social and health aspects to the well-being of our elderly,” said Ms Ng, who is married with one child.

During the Covid-19 outbreak, she said she helped bring in tele-health systems for community care facilities like the Singapore Expo.

“We were working Monday to Sunday, there were no boundaries of work days to tackle the problem because it was 24/7,” she said, adding that she mobilised volunteers to help with Bengali and Tamil translations for infected migrant workers.

“It was really all hands on deck...Covid-19 is still with us, and I’ll continue to be part of the fight against the virus.”

ZHULKARNAIN ABDUL RAHIM, 39, lawyer

Mr Zhulkarnain, a partner at law firm Dentons Rodyk and Davidson, spoke of the need to build on community modes of distribution, such as neighbour networks to support the needy, and to “entrench this idea of humanness” in policy-making.

Over the last decade, the father of three has conducted free legal clinics and done pro bono work as an assigned solicitor with the Legal Aid Bureau. He was previously the chairman of the Association of Muslim Professionals.

He was the fifth of six children. His mother was a housewife and his father did odd blue-collar jobs when they were growing up, eventually joining a construction company and working his way up to the rank of supervisor.

“From him, I remember the importance of lifelong learning,” said Mr Zhulkarnain, who would go through his father’s presentation slides with him as his father did not know how to use PowerPoint.

“The Covid-19 circuit breaker period has shown up various digital inequalities amongst our people, such as those who cannot afford digital devices to do home-based learning,” he said.

“But what I feel is that beyond digital connectivity, it is human connectivity that we would have to look at in terms of policymaking and process.”",0.31476769262483545,0.07515984015984015,Positive

DESMOND TAN KOK MING, 50

Former People's Association head

For Mr Desmond Tan, securing a government scholarship in his teens was the only way he could afford his university education.

But such social mobility among children from low-income families has become ""quite challenging"" in recent years, he said yesterday. It is a cause the father of three plans to champion if he gets elected.

Mr Tan grew up in a three-room Bukit Ho Swee flat that at one time housed 12 people - his own family of six, his uncle's family of four, his grandmother, and another uncle.

His father was a taxi driver, while his mother took on various jobs to supplement the family's income. These included working in a factory, as a babysitter, and selling satay and nasi lemak on the streets.

Mr Tan, a former Queenstown Secondary Technical School student, later went to Raffles Junior College. He was awarded the Singapore Armed Forces Merit Scholarship and graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1994 with first class honours in aeronautical engineering.

Mr Tan rose to the rank of brigadier-general before leaving to helm the People's Association in January 2017. There, he introduced Residents' Networks and Youth Networks to encourage social mixing.

EDWARD CHIA BING HUI, 36

Co-founder and managing director of Timbre Group

Helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) transform and ride out the Covid-19 crisis is one of Mr Edward Chia's top priorities if he is elected to Parliament.

His own business, the Timbre Group, runs food and beverage venues including Timbre+ and Yishun Park Hawker Centre, and has had to grapple with the impact of Covid-19 and deal with other common challenges SMEs deal with - coping with high rentals, insufficient manpower, and staying ahead of digital disruption.

""I go through this on a daily basis,"" he said. ""I can truly empathise with SMEs and I hope to be an effective voice for SMEs in Parliament.""

Mr Chia, the father of a six-year-old boy, is expected to be fielded in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC. He went to National Junior College and studied economics and political science at the National University of Singapore. He started Timbre at 21 when he was an undergraduate.

Said Mr Chia: ""We must redouble our efforts to support our SMEs - not just to survive, but to emerge stronger. In essence, stronger SMEs mean better jobs for Singaporeans.""

NADIA AHMAD SAMDIN, 30

Associate director at TSMP Law Corporation

Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin's life has revolved around giving back to the community since she was 15 years old. She started her volunteer work with the South East Community Development Council, and moved on to focus on causes that help vulnerable women and children.

The lawyer, who is married and has no children, recounted how she once received a call from a child she was mentoring. The girl, whose parents were in prison, needed to go to school for a test. However, there was no money in her ez-link card. The incident prompted Ms Nadia to set up the Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud Top-up Fund, to make sure such children have enough money for transport.

The youngest among the new faces that will be unveiled by the PAP, Ms Nadia went to Victoria Junior College and read law at the Singapore Management University.

Apart from her community work, she also serves as a panel adviser for the Youth Court, where her role is to advise judges on the appropriate orders to pass in cases involving children and young persons.

The recreational diver has also seen first-hand the havoc wrought by climate change on the natural environment and hopes to champion this cause.

Mr Wee grew up in a rental flat and made the cut to enter junior college after finishing his O levels at Nan Hua High School. However, money was tight, so he decided to enrol in a diploma programme at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, so that he could start work early and help his family with the bills.

After completing his national service, Mr Wee joined a local bank as a non-executive staff member, and got an accounting degree after some years of part-time study.

He later qualified as a chartered accountant.

He has been a grassroots leader in West Coast for 16 years, and also speaks Hokkien and Cantonese.

Mr Wee, who has two children, is a member of the Institute of Mental Health's Visitors' Board. He said he hopes to help the less privileged, as well as those with mental health problems. He also hopes to help small and medium-sized enterprises.

Said Mr Wee: ""I hope that... politics can be an extension of my volunteerism, and a platform for me to raise residents' concerns and needs to policymakers.""

Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman is a former army colonel who stepped down as deputy chief executive of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) in March. He helped to form and steer the M³@Bedok initiative, launched last year to help the Malay/Muslim community in Bedok Town.

The father of four joined the National Trades Union Congress' Administration and Research Unit in April, and has been spotted on the ground in Marine Parade group representation constituency.

Before he was appointed to his post in Muis, he spent 26 years in the Singapore Armed Forces. His military career included a six-month deployment to Blangpidie for the Aceh Monitoring Mission in 2005, where he was the deputy team leader.

His late father was a gas checker, while his late mother was a cleaner. When he was in primary school, he would help her clear rubbish, he said. She later upgraded her skills to become a cook in a factory.

That is why, said Mr Fahmi, the welfare of low-wage workers in essential services is close to his heart.

Mr Yip received the Public Service Commission Overseas Specialist Award and started his civil service career as a physical education and mathematics teacher.

He later served in the education, manpower and defence ministries. He said he plans to help to improve aged care services in Singapore.

One incident he remembered vividly from when he first started out as a teacher, he said, was when he disciplined a student who repeatedly failed to hand in his homework.

He later found out that the student came from a poor family, and had to work part time after school. That is why he did not have the time or energy to focus on his school work.

This incident taught him the value of empathy, said Mr Yip, who is married with five children.

""That day, I learnt that it is very important to always ask and seek to understand the situation before we come to any conclusions about how others behave... This is how I will also continue to listen to the concerns of residents.""

Ms Soh, who was in the Normal (Academic) stream at Bendemeer Secondary School, later obtained a diploma in law and management from a polytechnic, and worked as a paralegal before saving enough money to pursue a law degree overseas.

She recounted how her secondary school teacher advised her that if she became a lawyer some day, she should serve ""the lost, the least and the last"".

This, she said, became her ethos in life and inspired her to get involved in grassroots work. For the last nine years, she has volunteered in Bukit Panjang, helping outgoing Bukit Panjang MP Teo Ho Pin.

Ms Soh, who has a 16-month-old daughter, co-chairs the Law Society's community legal clinics committee and set up the first community legal clinic in a residents' committee centre in the area.

She hopes to increase community awareness of legal issues, like the importance of lasting power of attorney, and make legal help more accessible, especially to those who are physically disabled. During the circuit breaker period, she was able to mobilise volunteer lawyers to conduct sessions over the phone or virtually.

Ms Yeo was part of the global operations team at the EDB. She now runs Caregiver Asia, a social enterprise that connects those in need of care with freelance caregivers in Singapore. She said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly in Singapore to continue to work or contribute to the community.

Ms Yeo said one of the most meaningful things at EDB was “being able to work on projects that created and brought in very good and meaningful jobs for all Singaporeans”. She added that she started her social enterprise as she saw a gap in the provision of home-care services, in particular long-term care for the elderly.

On why she left the civil service to start her own venture, she said: “My grandmother...was ill for a number of years before she passed on. And it was spending her twilight years together with me that I realised the importance of being able to grow old with grace and dignity.”

Ms Yeo said she hopes to create more opportunities for the elderly to continue to work or contribute to the community, and wants to champion caregiving programmes.

Ms Yeo, who is married, said: “Politics allows me to bring together the type of experiences I have with the civil service, and working in the community... and to be able to influence not just day-to-day operations of helping people, but also to bring it up to a larger platform such that I can (have an impact on) national policies.”

Mr Tan has been a grassroots volunteer since 2005, working together with Jalan Besar GRC MP Lily Neo in Kreta Ayer-Kim Seng.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said he faced obstacles in his education journey – he was once held back a grade, and did not do well enough to enter a local university.

Despite the earlier setbacks, he earned a Bachelor of Economics with First Class Honours from Sydney University, and later, a Master in Public Policy from Harvard University. He has worked at the Ministry of Defence, the United Nations and non-profit group Oxfam, as well as in investment banking. He is now in the technology sector - earlier at social media giant Facebook and now at social networking platform LinkedIn.

Mr Tan said he hopes to use his skills and experience in the public, private and non-profit sectors to help Singaporeans become more nimble and prepared for the future of work.

He said he also aims to bridge the digital divide for seniors and other vulnerable groups, adding that the Covid-19 pandemic has hastened the need for all Singaporeans to acquire such digital skills. Work is now being done to help these groups, and more needs to be done, he said.

Said Mr Tan: “By the time Covid-19 is over... if we (still) haven’t become comfortable with technology, I think we might have failed our people.

“And so I will continue to really tirelessly advocate, and go to the ground and help all our students, stallholders... prepare for the future of work that has come much sooner than any of us has expected.”

Dr Wan Rizal, who is married with four children, started volunteering in the community in 2010. He was chairman of Al-Islah mosque in Punggol, and was also part of Punggol's Interracial and Religious Confidence Circle.

He was a student in the Normal (Academic) stream before obtaining a polytechnic diploma and enrolling in the National Institute of Education and later Nanyang Technological University, where he obtained his degree in physical education at the age of 31.

He said: “I hope to be the voice in Parliament that upholds social mobility. Because of the non-linear path that I had taken, I strongly believe that education is the key to social mobility. This is how we can allow people who have less, or did less well to move up and prevent our society from being stratified.

“Singapore must continue to be a nation of opportunities for all, not for just the privileged few, or the lucky ones, but for every Singaporean.”

Singapore’s education system is on the right track, he said. He added that he hopes to be part of its further development. For instance, he said he sees the value of early childhood education, and the importance of providing multiple pathways for Singaporeans to continue developing their skills.

He also hopes to advocate for the sandwiched class, as well as those who may face difficulties juggling work and family life.

Mr Chua grew up in a three-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. His father was a forklift driver and his mother was a seamstress.

He was awarded the Local Merit Scholarship (Civil Defence) by the Public Service Commission to read communications studies at Nanyang Technological University. He served with the SCDF, eventually becoming commander of the 3rd SCDF Division.

Most recently, he was director of the SGSecure Programme Office in Ministry of Home Affairs.

Mr Chua, whose baby boy is eight days old, has spent 15 years doing community work with youth. He said he finds joy and satisfaction in mentoring young people and seeing them find success in life.

He added that he hopes to continue his work with youth and to hear their concerns on issues such as social mobility and income inequality.

Mr Lye, a father of three, has been volunteering for 25 years.

When introducing himself, he recounted how he and other volunteers helped a low-income resident deal with a problem.

Mr Lye, who chairs the Punggol East Citizens’ Consultative Committee, said the resident’s daughter had obtained a scholarship from an unnamed agency that allowed her to enter university despite her family’s finances.

But the agency later asked the resident to cough up a large sum of money as her daughter’s grades were not good.

Mr Lye said that after several attempts, he and other volunteers managed to get the agency to write off the sum and the family was able to save up enough money to buy their own flat and move out of the rental block.

Despite having volunteered for groups like clan societies and trade associations, Mr Lye said that he finds community work most fulfilling. “Most satisfying for me is community work, where I get to listen to residents in their homes, their void decks and the coffee shops,” said Mr Lye, who has been volunteering in the new Sengkang GRC.

“I have always tried my best to help, as no government policy is foolproof and there are those who may fall through the cracks.”

Sembawang is a special place for Ms Poh, a former helicopter pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the first woman to be appointed full-time aide-de-camp to the late President S R Nathan.

She spent a lot time in Sembawang when she was based at Sembawang Air Base for the RSAF.

“Sembawang is really a very special place for me, plenty of fond memories. And now that I have a chance to go back to Sembawang to serve on the ground, I’m really excited to work closely with our volunteers with our residents there,” said Ms Poh, who started volunteering in grassroots activities and Meet-the-People sessions in Sembawang GRC in 2018.

Ms Poh, who is single, started an annual Women Festival for the constituency and also took part in distributing food to rental flat residents.

She is tipped to join the PAP team that will contest Sembawang GRC, which will likely lose Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan as he is expected to retire from politics soon.

Before taking up his position at DBS, Mr Goh headed its subsidary POSB, where he said he was exposed to volunteering efforts by community leaders and grassroots.

This inspired the father of three to take up community work.

Mr Goh spent more than 10 years at credit firm American Express, based in London and New York. He intends to use his experience from the international banking sector to help improve the lives of Singaporeans.

“I want to play a part to improve the system, to hone the system. And I know that Singapore is not perfect, but having lived in all these international financial centres, I can say personally that Singapore is the best,” he said.

“And therefore, I want to play a role to help Singapore adapt as the world changes very rapidly, given digitisation and the onset of the impact of new technology.”

Since 2013, Mr Goh has ben volunteering as a district councillor with the South West Community Development Council and also serves on the board of HomeTeamNS.

Mr Goh, who is vice-chairman of the Gambas-Yishun Citizens’ Consultative Committee, has been seen with Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam at community engagements in Nee Soon, where he is expected to be fielded.

Ms Gan, 46, who is married with three children, is now deputy chief executive officer of the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute.

She is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, where she has been active on the ground.

Ms Gan made history in 2015 when she became the first woman brigadier-general in Singapore. She resigned from her role as Chief of Staff - Air Staff in March.

She said she had served in the military for more than 25 years - ""one of the best choices and fulfilling choices that I made for myself"".

The armed forces, she said, is a place ""where men and women of different races, religions backgrounds, all come together, serving common goal to protect Singapore"". This desire to serve Singapore remained with her even after leaving the military.

The mission of the labour movement resonates with her, she said.

""I know the importance of bread and butter (issues) and the importance of having a job, to be able to protect one's lives, and their families"".

Asked about criticism that former military personnel are not qualified to be politicians, Ms Gan said she takes pride in her military experience, which has equipped her with leadership skills.

She added that in her military career, other than operations, she had been involved in long-term planning, capability development and policy work, manpower, intelligence, among others.

""I would say that I have gathered... several building blocks that I think are critical to any good organising entity and I would say the leadership experiences that I gained and also the lessons I learnt in taking care of people will help me to be a good politician.""

She appealed to the public to not rely on stereotypes. ""I hope that people will give me a chance - don't look at me as just another general - look at me for who I am.""

Ms Ong, 47, who is single, has been active in West Coast GRC, where she serves as vice-chairman for the Telok Blangah Citizens' Consultative Committee.

She said that she is energised by two things - seeing every young person succeed in life, and adults flourish in all that they do.

In order to help young people succeed, she said ""we first must learn to listen to, to see, to hear, to understand and to care for the needs of the youth"".

She started Trybe, a charity with Institute of Public Character (IPC) status, in 2001.

Trybe runs the Singapore Boys Hostel, Community Rehabilitation Centre for first-time drug abusers as well as Trybe Aftercare. It provides young people with guidance and offers support for their families and communities.

Ms Ong also holds a Master's in Business Administration from global business school Insead and Tsinghua University.

He stressed that such digital transformation cannot take place at the expense of others.

""For the seniors, for the low-wage workers, and for the less able - we have to make sure that they are part of this journey together. We will ensure that we leave no one behind.""

Mr Yeo, a lawyer, has chaired the party's Paya Lebar branch in opposition-held Aljunied GRC for more than three years.

He said he would like to help seniors and support less privileged families in Paya Lebar.

Another item on his to-do list is to address the challenges faced by parents of young children, who have to juggle between their work and family needs.

He said he fell in love with his wife, Priya, who is Hindu and South Asian, despite them being different culturally and having different religions ""because we share many similar Singaporean values and experiences"".

""We are thankful that Singapore is the home where children can be whoever they wish, and yet have a singular identity - that of being Singaporeans,"" said Mr Yeo, who is Catholic. He sees such values demonstrated in the community as well throughout his volunteering experiences.

""I hope to play my small part in contributing to continue to grow our inclusive society that we have worked so hard over so many years.""

Asked about the PAP team's chances at the upcoming election in wresting Aljunied GRC back from the Workers' Party, Mr Yeo said that while he is unable to speculate on the outcome, the team has been working hard on the ground for more than nine years to serve residents in the area.

Ms Mariam grew up in a one-room rental flat in Toa Payoh.

The daughter of a Malay teacher and a nurse, she said that while she had a happy childhood, there were moments when she knew things were not easy.

She would wake up in the middle of the night to find her father still working hard at the translation jobs he took on the side. Once, a burglar broke in and stole a whole month's salary that her father had just withdrawn from the ATM.

""Thanks to the sacrifices of my parents, the kindness shown by many and the quality of the Singapore education system, I've been able to go on to study at some of the best universities in the world and then work for some of the best companies in the world,"" she said.

Ms Mariam, who is Singapore managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group, has a bachelor's and master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University and a Master's in Business Administration from Harvard Business School.

The vice-chairman of the Woodlands Community Club management committee is married with no children.

She said she is passionate about early childhood education, as she believes primary school is too late to start pushing for social mobility.

If she were to speak now to a young girl growing up in a rental flat like herself, she said, she would ask her to ""go out and be aggressive about what you want. Find your allies and your supporters"".

""Don't be afraid, don't limit yourself to thinking you can only take certain kinds of jobs. You can be a senior banker, you can be a law partner. We have it in this country to provide opportunities for everyone.""

She began grassroots work in Siglap in 2000, later becoming the chairman of the Siglap Citizens' Consultative Committee.

In 2015, she moved to become an adviser to Aljunied Grassroots Organisations.

The mother of two, who works as a marketing director at Jingslink Marketing, hopes to speak up for low-income families.

""We have women who, because they have to look after their children, cannot go out to work, so we need to have more childcare facilities and negotiate affordable childcare so women can have the peace of mind to go out and earn living,"" she said.

That is what the Government will be seeking at the general election on July 10, said the Minister in the Prime Minister's Office.

""There will be challenges,"" he told The Straits Times. ""We should take this opportunity to seek the mandate from the people to move forward.""

Mr Ng, who was part of the PAP team that won the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC in 2015, is set to move to neighbouring Sengkang from his Punggol North ward.

He has been walking the ground in Sengkang estate recently and spoke last evening at Anchorvale Community Club, where he attended the launch of a programme that gives out computers to students from low-income families.

He was joined at the event by Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min, whose Sengkang West ward was carved up in the redrawing of constituency boundaries, with part of it in the new Sengkang GRC.

With them was lawyer Raymond Lye, chairman of the Punggol East Citizens' Consultative Committee and another potential candidate.

Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs and Health Amrin Amin is tipped to move over from Sembawang GRC to complete the four-man slate.

The new GRC, which has 120,166 voters, comprises parts of the existing Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, as well as the single seat of Punggol East and parts of Sengkang West.

It is expected to be contested by the Workers' Party (WP), which held Punggol East from 2013 to 2015 and fielded a candidate in Sengkang West in previous elections.

A WP team led by former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian has been walking the ground in Sengkang.

Yesterday, about 20 refurbished computers donated by charity RSVP Singapore were given out to students to kick-start the programme.

A FRESH MANDATE There will be challenges... We should take this opportunity to seek the mandate from the people to move forward. MR NG CHEE MENG, labour chief and Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, on what the PAP will be seeking at the general election on July 10.

Related Story Singapore GE2020: PAP unveils first slate of candidates for July 10 general election

Called Sengkang Goes Digital, the initiative was started by youth volunteers from Punggol East, Sengkang Central and Sengkang West.

It aims to give PCs or laptops to more than 100 primary and secondary school students from low-income families in Sengkang. The idea came about during the two-month circuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19, when students had to do home-based learning.

Meanwhile, the pandemic was a hot topic at a virtual dialogue held yesterday with Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC residents.

Minister of State for Manpower and National Development Zaqy Mohamad recounted how he had looked forward to going out for a meal once the reopening allowed it. But he felt guilty about dining in and ended up getting a takeaway instead. ""What's different is that after three months of being locked in, you almost feel guilty for trying to find a place to makan (eat)... You feel like it's better to tarpau (buy a takeaway) back home,"" he said.

His caution was praised by National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who said all Singaporeans need to cooperate in order to avoid a second circuit breaker to contain the virus.

The two outgoing PAP MPs - along with fellow outgoing MPs Alex Yam and Ong Teng Koon - were sharing their thoughts on life amid the pandemic at the dialogue.

Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force combating the Covid-19 outbreak, noted the number of coronavirus cases will rise as the economy opens up and people interact more. Citing China, South Korea and New Zealand as examples, he said: ""It will happen, it has happened in all the countries that exited from their lockdowns.""

He said the Government will try to prevent large clusters from forming as more cases surface. It will consider localised restrictions such as shutting down an affected office, he said.

""But at the end of the day, in order not to go into a circuit breaker again, we really need everyone to cooperate and to do our part - to change our habits and adopt new mindsets,"" Mr Wong added.

Mr Zaqy said businesses and individuals are already hard-hit by the earlier restrictions. ""It's not so much just whether the Government can afford another circuit breaker, but can the economy afford one more round of this?

""The second issue is the psychological impact, because if you think about it, how long can you keep people inside their homes?""

Asked about the progress in finding an effective vaccine, Mr Wong said there is a good chance that one will be developed, somewhere in the world. But even if there is a vaccine, concerns will remain over how long it can offer protection and if it can be distributed around the world efficiently.

""There are a lot of uncertainties and there are no clear answers,"" Mr Wong added.

The dialogue, done via a live stream on Facebook, is the first of five to be conducted by the current PAP team for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC in the lead-up to the general election. Each dialogue will be centred on a particular topic.

Mr Wong started yesterday's session by thanking residents for their support in the past five years. He appealed for their support in the coming election, noting that there are challenges ahead.

In response to a question on whether the current PAP team will remain unchanged for the election, he said: ""That is the big question... we may very well have a new member in our team, but I think that is something to be shared for a later programme.""",0.3989098575036074,0.08950329184704188,Positive

RP secretary-general Kenneth Jeyaretnam announced the decision at about 1.30am yesterday in a Facebook post, just hours after Parliament was dissolved and the Writ of Election issued.

The move likely leaves PSP to take on the incumbent PAP team in a head-to-head fight for West Coast.

On June 15, Mr Jeyaretnam unveiled six candidates, half of whom had been part of RP's 2015 team in West Coast, raising expectations of a three-cornered fight.

But yesterday, he said RP had been in ""long talks"" with PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock, and decided the ""greater cause"" at the moment was opposition unity and contesting where everyone has the greatest chance of winning seats.

""We also recognise that Dr Tan has a tough fight on his hands despite it being his old stomping ground and we do not wish to hinder his progress,"" he said.

Dr Tan thanked RP for not contesting West Coast.

""We all understand the implications of a three-cornered fight, so we are trying to put our differences aside so that we can contest with the PAP one on one,"" he told reporters yesterday morning.

The PAP defeated RP in West Coast in 2015 and 2011, and has won every election there since the constituency was formed in 1997.

But Dr Tan also often speaks of West Coast as his ""home"" ground.

It contains the former single seat Ayer Rajah, where he was the PAP's MP for 26 years until it was absorbed into the GRC in 2006.

Without revealing specific areas, Mr Jeyaretnam said PSP will withdraw from ""various grounds"" in return for West Coast. He said PSP also offered to cede Nee Soon GRC, but RP decided not to contest it.

Last night, a PSP spokesman confirmed that the party will still be contesting Nee Soon GRC, among nine constituencies announced by the party on Tuesday. When announcing the list of constituencies, Dr Tan had said it could still change.

""Of course, on Nomination Day, things change. Politics is very fluid, so we will study all these places more carefully,"" he said.

RP and PSP still have overlapping claims in Yio Chu Kang SMC. When asked if PSP might pull out to avoid a multi-cornered fight, the spokesman said that as of now, PSP still intends to contest Yio Chu Kang.

Party sources told The Straits Times that the candidate for Yio Chu Kang has already been decided, and is among the dozen unveiled by PSP so far.

Mr Jeyaretnam also said RP will contest in Radin Mas SMC and Ang Mo Kio GRC.

RP's decision to cede West Coast also prompted other concessions.

In a Facebook post at about 2.30am yesterday, the People's Power Party said it welcomed the RP's decision, adding that it ""will be most willing to take a step back"" and not field a candidate in Radin Mas, so that RP can focus on the ward.

As of yesterday, overlapping claims have yet to be resolved in at least four constituencies.

Both the Singapore People's Party (SPP) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have expressed interest in contesting the four-member Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, which a joint SPP-DPP team fought and lost in 2015 against the incumbent People's Action Party (PAP).

The five-member Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC could see the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), which contested it in 2015, and the new Peoples Voice (PV) vying for votes.

At least two SMCs could also see three-cornered fights, with the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) coming up against the DPP in Marymount SMC and the Reform Party (RP) in the new Yio Chu Kang SMC respectively.

The PSP and RP had earlier clashed over West Coast GRC, which includes the Ayer Rajah ward where PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock was the PAP MP for six terms. Early yesterday morning, the RP, which contested West Coast in 2011 and 2015, said it would step aside after negotiations with the PSP.

The ruling PAP is contesting all 93 seats. Its pitch to voters is that it needs a strong mandate to be able to tackle the big challenges Singapore faces amid the pandemic-induced crisis.

Contests involving multiple parties have tended to benefit the ruling party, as the opposition vote ends up being split, observers note.

Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said multi-cornered fights are inevitable, especially in single-member constituencies, given the unprecedented number of parties contesting the election. But they are unlikely to happen in group representation constituencies, which require more resources to contest, he added.

""Even though there are a couple of GRCs with potential multi-cornered fights, my sense is once Nomination Day comes, the GRCs will likely be one-to-one fights.""

He felt the larger opposition parties were unlikely to pit themselves against one another.

Associate Professor Bilveer Singh from the National University of Singapore's (NUS) political science department agreed that three-or even four-cornered fights are inevitable. He said: ""The entrance of PSP onto the scene, as well as other new parties like PV and Red Dot United (RDU), has made the ground crowded and they all need to find a 'chair' somewhere to sit.""

STRAIGHT FIGHTS Even though there are a couple of GRCs with potential multi-cornered fights, my sense is once Nomination Day comes, the GRCs will likely be one-to-one fights. DR MUSTAFA IZZUDDIN, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore.

OPPOSITION POW-WOW There is not that much time if campaign collateral has to be produced, so I expect this to take place in the next day or two, if at all. It will be quite significant if no such meeting takes place. We will most definitely be in new territory with regard to opposition politics in Singapore if that is so. DR GILLIAN KOH, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, on opposition parties possibly holding off on having a conference for as long as possible while they wait for the PAP to announce where it is placing its candidates.

He noted that the much-hyped notion of an opposition coalition akin to Malaysia's Pakatan Harapan never materialised. Conflicts over ideologies and issues doomed this effort from the start, he added.

Political analyst Loke Hoe Yeong noted that even without an official alliance, the fact that the customary pre-election horse-trading talks between the opposition parties did not happen this year is a sign that opposition unity is fraying. But he said this is mostly due to the growing divergence between larger opposition parties and smaller parties, which are ""getting even smaller"". ""There is, frankly, no reason for the larger parties to have to negotiate with the smaller parties,"" said Mr Loke, who recently authored a book on the history of the opposition in Singapore titled The First Wave.

He said the opposition's earlier experiment with coalition-building, in the form of the SDA led by Mr Chiam See Tong, had ""failed miserably"" in the early 2000s. ""The idea was consigned to the grave in 2011, when the Workers' Party (WP) won its first GRC. That vindicated the WP's strategy of going it alone.""

Dr Gillian Koh, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, said opposition parties could be holding off on having a conference for as long as possible while they wait for the PAP to announce where it is placing its candidates.

""There is not that much time if campaign collateral has to be produced, so I expect this to take place in the next day or two, if at all,"" she said. ""It will be quite significant if no such meeting takes place. We will most definitely be in new territory with regard to opposition politics in Singapore if that is so.""

Dr Mustafa pointed to the coronavirus pandemic as one reason the usual opposition pow-wow could not be conducted in person this year. But he said the larger and more established opposition parties have likely been negotiating behind the scenes to avoid three-cornered fights - at least among themselves.

Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian from NUS' political science department agreed, adding that three-cornered fights seem more likely to happen between smaller parties.

""The WP and, to a lesser degree, the SDP are more established. If they do not appear in three-cornered fights, then there may be recognition from the other parties that they would lose badly in multi-cornered contests,"" he said.

Associate Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University's School of Law said political parties exist to contest elections. They risk becoming irrelevant and may never recover if they fail to contest an election, he said.

But he believed overlapping claims will likely be resolved come Nomination Day. Although there has not been a ""multilateral"" pow-wow, parties have been negotiating in a ""bilateral"" fashion, said Prof Tan, a former Nominated MP.

""They will resolve the conflicts because they recognise that the Singaporean voter is savvy and the party that finishes third or lower will likely lose its deposit. It's not a small sum and that's not a price that some candidates and parties are prepared to pay, in addition to the reputational damage done.""

The election deposit has been set at $13,500 per candidate, which is forfeited if the candidate or team fails to win at least 12.5 per cent of the votes.

In 2015, there were three SMCs that saw three-cornered fights. Of those, two involved independent candidates while the third, MacPherson, saw a contest between the PAP, the WP and the National Solidarity Party (NSP). Both independent candidates and the NSP's Cheo Chai Chen, who garnered just 215 votes (0.82 per cent) in MacPherson, lost their $14,500 deposits.

Related Story Singapore GE2020: What are the hot seats to watch this election

Prof Tan said there was also the possibility that the lack of coordination could result in some seats going uncontested, allowing the PAP to have walkovers instead of multi-cornered fights.

Another reason three-cornered fights are increasingly likely is that older opposition cooperation tactics, such as banking on the so-called ""by-election effect"", are no longer relevant, the observers said.

The strategy, employed by Mr Chiam in 1991, involves opposition parties agreeing to contest fewer than half of the available seats in total. Like in a by-election, the logic goes, returning the PAP to power on Nomination Day means voters would be less skittish about supporting the opposition as there is no risk of inadvertently voting the PAP out.

Prof Singh, Dr Koh and Mr Loke agreed that the strategy has been irrelevant since 1997 when the PAP started using a more local, municipal approach and tying estate upgrading to voter support.

Prof Tan suggested that the opposition could move towards a nuanced strategy based on a similar line of thinking.

Most parties are aware that, given the challenges posed to Singapore by the Covid-19 pandemic, voters are more likely to support the tried-and-tested PAP, he said. As a result, the SDP's call to deny the PAP its two-thirds majority may not sit well with voters, for example.

Instead, if the WP adopts a moderate approach by contesting fewer than 31 seats, that sends a signal to voters that the PAP will not lose its two-thirds majority, even if the WP wins every seat it contests, said Prof Tan.

""I think that would go down much better with voters,"" he said.

With so many parties vying for seats across the board, however, voters would have to weigh up the chances that some seats, or even GRCs, might also be won by other opposition parties, thereby resulting in a weakened ruling party, with some key ministers or potential office holders being lost in the process. The PAP will, no doubt, seek to convince voters that such an outcome would hamper the country's ability to deal with the big issues it has to grapple with in the face of the health and economic crises unleashed by Covid-19.",0.4912399185654999,0.052076971263017774,Positive

With large physical rallies disallowed in GE2020, in line with health advisories to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the constituency and party political broadcasts scheduled for prime time on national TV have taken on an added significance for candidates to reach out to voters.

The constituency political broadcasts, in particular, will give all candidates a chance to address voters on TV on Mediacorp's Channel 5.

Each candidate will get three minutes to speak, so a single-member constituency's broadcast will last three minutes, while that for a group representation constituency will be 12 or 15 minutes, depending on whether it is a four-or five-member GRC.

Recording will start from July 2, and candidates can opt to speak in any of the four official languages - English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, the Elections Department (ELD) said yesterday.

This means Chinese dialects, which are sometimes spoken at rallies, will not be allowed.

The constituency broadcasts may be the only way some parties may get TV airtime, as the party political broadcast time slots will be offered only to parties fielding at least six candidates under a recognised party symbol.

This rule, which was already in place in previous general elections, will remain this time round.

The ELD said eligible parties will be informed of their allocated time for the party political broadcasts on Nomination Day.

As with the constituency broadcasts, these party-level broadcasts can be delivered only in the four official languages.

BALANCE NEEDED There is a need to strike a balance between providing political parties and candidates with media platforms to reach out to voters, and keeping mainstream media non-partisan and neutral. THE ELECTIONS DEPARTMENT, on the amount of time allocated to political broadcasts for the general election.

All these broadcasts will be aired across 19 TV and radio channels.

The ELD said all broadcasts should not contain content that is of a libellous or criminal nature.

It added that the Infocomm Media Development Authority will issue more guidelines on the broadcasts by today.

As restrictions due to Covid-19 have caused much of the campaigning to go online, the Government will also provide venues for parties to live-stream their rallies.

Power, Internet connectivity and basic furnishings will be provided at these venues, but candidates must make their own arrangements to ensure successful delivery of their live streams.

Up to 10 venues will be provided each day, with three time slots - from 7am to 10am, noon to 3pm, and 7pm to 10pm - for each venue, and candidates can apply to use them from July 1 to 8. The booking fee for each time slot is $107.

The ELD said use of the venues is optional, and candidates are free to live-stream their rallies from other places.

It added that online platforms used for live-streaming will have to be declared to the Returning Officer. Foreigners are also barred from participating in these live streams.

""The increased airtime - in the form of greater audience reach through more platforms and at different timings - will help candidates to reach voters with varying media consumption habits at a national level,"" said ELD.

The department also stressed the importance of cyber security, and reminded political parties and candidates to protect their social media accounts, among other things.

""If candidates and political parties suspect their accounts or systems have been compromised or misused, they should lodge a police report immediately and keep ELD informed,"" it said.

These new faces also represent different segments of society and, therefore, will bring with them different issues and concerns to raise in Parliament, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat yesterday.

He said: ""What has been very encouraging for us is that we have now seen many Singaporeans who have taken the opportunity of embarking on very different pathways, whether it is education or in their career aspirations, or in the causes that they are interested in, and being able to make headway to develop themselves fully in this process.

""What is even more encouraging is that many of them have decided to step forward, so that they can share these experiences, they can continue this process of enabling more Singaporeans to succeed in the coming years.""

Mr Heng was speaking at a virtual press meeting to unveil the first batch of the 26 new PAP faces who will contest next month's election.

The youngest PAP candidate in this election is lawyer Nadia Ahmad Samdin, 30, who was among the four people Mr Heng introduced yesterday.

The identity of the oldest, aged 56, has not been revealed yet.

The median age of this year's line-up is 43. This is older than the 42.3 median age of the 2015 batch, and also the oldest group of newbies in more than 40 years.

In a statement yesterday, the PAP said it has also made ""significant efforts"" to bring in more women candidates, with 10 featuring in the line-up this year.

About 20 MPs are expected to step down in the run-up to the polls.

Mr Heng, who is PAP's first assistant secretary-general, said the party will contest all 93 seats in the July 10 election, which means it will field candidates in 17 group representation constituencies and 14 single-member constituencies.

He added that party renewal is part of the process through which the PAP improves its ability to better serve Singaporeans and take the country forward.

On Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's decision to hold the election now, Mr Heng said Singapore will face external challenges in the years ahead. Many critical decisions have to be made, and the strategy and actions Singapore takes in the coming months will profoundly shape its future.

That is why the decision was taken to hold the election on July 10, he said.

Mr Heng said: ""We need to build the adaptive capacity of our society to overcome this crisis and to emerge stronger, so that we can have the ideas and creative energies of all our people to work together on a common purpose.""

Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli, in a separate press conference to introduce four more new faces, echoed Mr Heng's views.

Mr Masagos, who is PAP's vice-chairman, said one common quality among the new PAP candidates is that they never stop learning and they all have the desire to give back to society. Their actions, too, give an insight into how committed they are in working for the community, he added.

""Do not just light your own candle - light a thousand candles before your light goes out,"" he said.

Responding to questions about why candidates were being unveiled at the party's Bedok headquarters, and not at the constituency level like for the 2015 election, Mr Masagos said the decision was influenced by the Covid-19 pandemic, which meant candidates need to be introduced in a manner that was ""safe, convenient, and also as productive as possible"".

DESMOND TAN KOK MING, 50

Former People's Association head

For Mr Desmond Tan, securing a government scholarship in his teens was the only way he could afford his university education.

But such social mobility among children from low-income families has become ""quite challenging"" in recent years, he said yesterday. It is a cause the father of three plans to champion if he gets elected.

Mr Tan grew up in a three-room Bukit Ho Swee flat that at one time housed 12 people - his own family of six, his uncle's family of four, his grandmother, and another uncle.

His father was a taxi driver, while his mother took on various jobs to supplement the family's income. These included working in a factory, as a babysitter, and selling satay and nasi lemak on the streets.

Mr Tan, a former Queenstown Secondary Technical School student, later went to Raffles Junior College. He was awarded the Singapore Armed Forces Merit Scholarship and graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1994 with first class honours in aeronautical engineering.

Mr Tan rose to the rank of brigadier-general before leaving to helm the People's Association in January 2017. There, he introduced Residents' Networks and Youth Networks to encourage social mixing.

EDWARD CHIA BING HUI, 36

Co-founder and managing director of Timbre Group

Helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) transform and ride out the Covid-19 crisis is one of Mr Edward Chia's top priorities if he is elected to Parliament.

His own business, the Timbre Group, runs food and beverage venues including Timbre+ and Yishun Park Hawker Centre, and has had to grapple with the impact of Covid-19 and deal with other common challenges SMEs deal with - coping with high rentals, insufficient manpower, and staying ahead of digital disruption.

""I go through this on a daily basis,"" he said. ""I can truly empathise with SMEs and I hope to be an effective voice for SMEs in Parliament.""

Mr Chia, the father of a six-year-old boy, is expected to be fielded in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC. He went to National Junior College and studied economics and political science at the National University of Singapore. He started Timbre at 21 when he was an undergraduate.

Said Mr Chia: ""We must redouble our efforts to support our SMEs - not just to survive, but to emerge stronger. In essence, stronger SMEs mean better jobs for Singaporeans.""

NADIA AHMAD SAMDIN, 30

Associate director at TSMP Law Corporation

Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin's life has revolved around giving back to the community since she was 15 years old. She started her volunteer work with the South East Community Development Council, and moved on to focus on causes that help vulnerable women and children.

The lawyer, who is married and has no children, recounted how she once received a call from a child she was mentoring. The girl, whose parents were in prison, needed to go to school for a test. However, there was no money in her ez-link card. The incident prompted Ms Nadia to set up the Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud Top-up Fund, to make sure such children have enough money for transport.

The youngest among the new faces that will be unveiled by the PAP, Ms Nadia went to Victoria Junior College and read law at the Singapore Management University.

Apart from her community work, she also serves as a panel adviser for the Youth Court, where her role is to advise judges on the appropriate orders to pass in cases involving children and young persons.

The recreational diver has also seen first-hand the havoc wrought by climate change on the natural environment and hopes to champion this cause.

IVAN LIM SHAW CHUAN, 42

General manager (Specialised Vessels) at Keppel Offshore & Marine

At age 16, Mr Ivan Lim went to work at Keppel Shipyard after his O levels in 1994, instead of furthering his studies.

""I remember on my first day, the shipyard uncles were asking me, 'What are you doing here in the shipyard? You should be studying',"" he said.

Mr Lim was living in a rental flat in Henderson with his family at the time, and circumstances were such that he had ""no choice but to start working"".

He worked hard and was awarded a scholarship by Keppel to study for a diploma at Singapore Polytechnic, after which he continued to pursue his degree in marine engineering, graduating with first class honours at the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

Rising through the ranks, Mr Lim is now general manager at Keppel Offshore and Marine.

Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, who introduced Mr Lim yesterday, said he has had a very unusual journey in his education.

Mr Lim, who is married with four children, is expected to be fielded in Jurong GRC. He said he wants to champion the needs of the vulnerable. ""I'm concerned about elderly residents and children who require social assistance, especially those with special needs.""

DON WEE BOON HONG, 43

Senior vice-president at UOB

Mr Wee grew up in a rental flat and made the cut to enter junior college after finishing his O levels at Nan Hua High School. However, money was tight, so he decided to enrol in a diploma programme at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, so that he could start work early and help his family with the bills.

After completing his national service, Mr Wee joined a local bank as a non-executive staff member, and got an accounting degree after some years of part-time study.

He later qualified as a chartered accountant.

He has been a grassroots leader in West Coast for 16 years, and also speaks Hokkien and Cantonese.

Mr Wee, who has two children, is a member of the Institute of Mental Health's Visitors' Board. He said he hopes to help the less privileged, as well as those with mental health problems. He also hopes to help small and medium-sized enterprises.

Said Mr Wee: ""I hope that... politics can be an extension of my volunteerism, and a platform for me to raise residents' concerns and needs to policymakers.""

MOHD FAHMI ALIMAN, 48

Former Islamic Religious Council of Singapore deputy chief executive

Mr Mohd Fahmi Aliman is a former army colonel who stepped down as deputy chief executive of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) in March. He helped to form and steer the M³@Bedok initiative, launched last year to help the Malay/Muslim community in Bedok Town.

The father of four joined the National Trades Union Congress' Administration and Research Unit in April, and has been spotted on the ground in Marine Parade group representation constituency.

Before he was appointed to his post in Muis, he spent 26 years in the Singapore Armed Forces. His military career included a six-month deployment to Blangpidie for the Aceh Monitoring Mission in 2005, where he was the deputy team leader.

His late father was a gas checker, while his late mother was a cleaner. When he was in primary school, he would help her clear rubbish, he said. She later upgraded her skills to become a cook in a factory.

That is why, said Mr Fahmi, the welfare of low-wage workers in essential services is close to his heart.

YIP HON WENG, 43

Former group chief of the Silver Generation Office under the Agency for Integrated Care

Mr Yip received the Public Service Commission Overseas Specialist Award and started his civil service career as a physical education and mathematics teacher.

He later served in the education, manpower and defence ministries. He said he plans to help to improve aged care services in Singapore.

One incident he remembered vividly from when he first started out as a teacher, he said, was when he disciplined a student who repeatedly failed to hand in his homework.

He later found out that the student came from a poor family, and had to work part-time after school. That is why he did not have the time or energy to focus on his school work.

This incident taught him the value of empathy, said Mr Yip, who is married with five children.

""That day, I learnt that it is very important to always ask and seek to understand the situation before we come to any conclusions about how others behave... This is how I will also continue to listen to the concerns of residents.""

HANY SOH HUI BIN, 33

Director at MSC Law Corporation

Ms Soh, who was in the Normal (Academic) stream at Bendemeer Secondary School, later obtained a diploma in law and management from a polytechnic, and worked as a paralegal before saving enough money to pursue a law degree overseas.

She recounted how her secondary school teacher advised her that if she became a lawyer some day, she should serve ""the lost, the least and the last"".

This, she said, became her ethos in life and inspired her to get involved in grassroots work. For the last nine years, she has volunteered in Bukit Panjang, helping outgoing Bukit Panjang MP Teo Ho Pin.

Ms Soh, who has a 16-month-old daughter, co-chairs the Law Society's community legal clinics committee and set up the first community legal clinic in a residents' committee centre in the area.

She hopes to increase community awareness of legal issues, like the importance of lasting power of attorney, and make legal help more accessible, especially to those who are physically disabled. During the circuit breaker period, she was able to mobilise volunteer lawyers to conduct sessions over the phone or virtually.

This means that when voters or supporters become too effusive and the parties are unable to control the crowd, they may want to consider disengaging and leaving the area in the interest of public health, the ELD said yesterday.

A day after the Writ of Election was issued, outreach activities were ramped up and yesterday, the ELD gave more details on how potential candidates should conduct themselves during nomination proceedings and campaigning.

There were rules set out in the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, and also best practices.

At an online media briefing attended by ELD representatives as well as National Environment Agency chief executive officer Tan Meng Dui, who will be the election's Returning Officer, the ELD said that said the same Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines that apply to the public will also apply to the political candidates.

An issue that has caused confusion is the wearing of masks, with some candidates keeping them on at all times and others removing them when posing for photos.

Yesterday, the ELD said candidates have to follow the MOH's rules on mask wearing, and they should keep their masks on when they are taking photos or talking to others.

An exception to the mask rule is when candidates are eating or drinking at hawker centres. Even then, they should minimise talking as a best practice, to reduce the risk of droplets spreading, the ELD added.

Another instance where they may remove their masks is when they are recording, say a doorstop interview, for only a few minutes, and this is done in places where they can keep a safe distance of at least 1m away from others.

In these situations, all other individuals around the candidate who is speaking should keep their masks on, said the ELD.

But it is best if candidates keep their masks on in these situations, the ELD added. ""This is especially so when in settings where it may be difficult to maintain safe distancing or comply with other safe management measures.""

It also advised candidates to bring masks, adding that misplacing or forgetting to bring masks out is not a reasonable excuse for not wearing one in public.

Since the general election was called on Tuesday, many parties have hit the campaign trail on walkabouts while keeping their groups to no more than five people. Most have also kept to the rules of maintaining a 1m distance from others.

The ELD acknowledged this, saying it shows that campaigning can be done while respecting the safety measures that have been put in place to guard against the spread of the coronavirus.

It called on the political parties to set a good example, and nudge their supporters in the right direction.

Some of its suggestions were for candidates and volunteers to keep interactions with the public transient and to avoid handshakes, high fives and fist bumps to minimise physical contact.

In addition, they should leave a location when the crowd becomes unmanageable, and ensure that people do not crowd around to collect fliers or election paraphernalia.

Safe distancing measures should be put in place, if people are standing in a queue or at a table to collect the items, it added.

Members of the public can play their part too, said the ELD, suggesting that people watch political broadcasts at home, and avoid gathering or loitering near nomination centres during nomination proceedings.

When candidates and volunteers visit, people should also allow into their home only up to five visitors, all of whom should be masked up.

Encouraging candidates to take their temperature daily and to stay home if they are unwell, the ELD said: ""All political parties and candidates are strongly encouraged to exercise positive leadership and set a good example to the public, by following these best practices.

But the proceedings this year will be much more subdued, with entry into the centres restricted owing to Covid-19.

Nomination Day is on June 30 in this general election.

As in previous elections, candidates are required to submit their documents at these centres and be accompanied by their subscribers, who include a proposer, a seconder and between four to eight assentors.

From 10am, candidates can enter the schools which are being used as nomination centres.

They will first be directed into a holding area and, from 10.30am, they can enter the nomination place, typically the school hall, if they meet the requirement of having the relevant documents, like a political donation certificate. They must also be accompanied by their subscribers.

Between 11am and 12pm, candidates will have to file their nomination papers. They have up to 12.30pm to object to the nomination papers of other candidates contesting in the same constituency.

Supporters, who are typically allowed in the centres as well, will not be able to enter them in this election.

After 12.30pm, candidates will be allowed to make their thank-you speeches, which will be aired on TV and online. For candidates who are unwell, their authorised representative can make the speech on their behalf.

To reduce physical contact during nomination proceedings, the Elections Department has beefed up its digital services for candidates.

Before Nomination Day, candidates can pay their election deposit of $13,500 via e-payment, like PayNow, and get an electronic receipt, instead of making a trip to the Accountant-General's Department. They can also appoint election agents and apply for a political donation certificate online, as well as apply online for a minority community certificate for those running in group representation constituencies.

The ELD said yesterday it would process most of these forms by the next working day, except for applications for the minority community certificates which will be issued before Nomination Day, after applications for the certificates close two clear days before Nomination Day.

Candidates can also submit their photographs and names for printing on ballot papers through the online channel.

Those who want to do a draft of their nomination papers online can also do so, which will allow them to check the details of their proposers, seconders and assentors to ensure they are all listed in the updated Register of Electors.

To use these online services, they will have to log in using their SingPass accounts, for accountability and security, said the ELD.

It added that candidates who prefer to submit forms in hard copy can continue to do so, but they should download and print the forms from the ELD website instead of getting them in person at the ELD's premises.

These and other changes to election processes for GE2020 are published in the Candidate Handbook, Guide for Polling Agents and Guide for Counting Agents. They are available on the ELD website.",0.38503968253968257,0.05805555555555557,Positive

At a breakfast meeting at Tiong Bahru Market, Dr Tan presented Mr Lee Hsien Yang with a membership card.

Dr Tan said that Mr Lee has been a member ""for quite some time"", but due to the Covid-19 situation, they were unable to have a proper membership card presentation ceremony.

""This morning, I have great pleasure in giving this Progress Singapore Party membership card to Lee Hsien Yang, who joined us quite some time ago.""

Mr Lee turned up at 8.30am at the market with Dr Tan and a group of PSP members, all of them wearing the party's red-and-white polo T-shirt.

The Straits Times had reported earlier yesterday that Mr Lee had joined the party, but party sources said he was unlikely to be fielded as a candidate at the election.

Asked if he would be standing for election, Mr Lee replied: ""When I'm ready to disclose that, you will find out.""

On why he joined the party, he said: ""I joined the party because I think that Dr Tan is committed to doing the right thing for Singapore and Singaporeans and he loves the country. And he has brought together a group of people who share his vision, and it is a vision which I believe will build a better Singapore.""

Dr Tan was similarly coy about whether Mr Lee would contest the polls: ""I'm not confirming... Don't worry. In politics, we know when to make our move. Timing is important.""

He noted that there were many ways Mr Lee could contribute to the party: ""He is not just an ordinary person. His father is the founder of Singapore, you know, so that's very important. And the fact (that) he has decided to join us is a clear indication that the current (Government) didn't follow what his dad wanted.""

The market where Dr Tan and Mr Lee met is located within Tanjong Pagar GRC, a stronghold of his late father, Singapore's founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. It is also one of nine constituencies the PSP has said it will be contesting in this election.

IT'S NOT TIME TO TELL I'm not confirming... Don't worry. In politics, we know when to make our move. Timing is important. DR TAN CHENG BOCK, on whether Mr Lee Hsien Yang would contest the polls.

Later in the evening, Mr Lee appeared in a brief online broadcast, appealing to Singaporeans to volunteer with the PSP and to donate generously.

He said: ""The PAP has lost its way. My sister Wei Ling shares this view too. In fact, she said so in a Facebook post in August 2016 before Oxleygate...

""It's possible to be loyal Singaporeans, to be proud of what has been accomplished in the past, to recite with pride 'we the citizens of Singapore', to love Singapore and yet to not vote PAP.""

He has been embroiled in a long-running feud with PM Lee over the fate of their father's house in Oxley Road.

Mr Lee's emergence comes a day after Parliament was dissolved and the Writ of Election was issued. Nomination Day is on June 30 and Polling Day on July 10.

Dr Tan said yesterday that he thought the timing of the election was ""irresponsible"" and potentially puts a lot of the elderly in a dangerous situation.

""The signs are there, it is so clear. And if they don't want to heed the signs, then the price they have to pay, as I said before, they might win this battle but they are going to lose the war.""

He has said on multiple occasions that he and Mr Lee Hsien Yang are good friends and that if Mr Lee wants to join PSP, it would have to be on the terms of the party.

The duo have been spotted before on several occasions having breakfast together, once at a hawker centre in the Prime Minister's ward.

In July last year, Mr Lee said on Facebook: ""I wholeheartedly support the principles and values of the Progress Singapore Party.""

The Elections Department (ELD) underscored this by issuing further safe distancing guidelines yesterday for those taking part in the July 10 polls.

Candidates will be required to wear masks at all times, except when they are eating or drinking.

Candidates will not be allowed to remove their masks for photographs or while talking to others and they must keep a distance of at least 1m from members of the public, said the ELD.

The outbreak has placed restrictions on physical campaigning and put a premium on the use of cyberspace, which was evident as parties introduced their new candidates yesterday.

The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) introduced the first eight of its 26 new candidates at two virtual press conferences yesterday while the opposition Workers' Party (WP) released a six-minute video on Facebook showcasing 12 likely candidates.

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who is also the PAP's first assistant secretary-general, told reporters from the party headquarters that the coming general election will be critical as Singaporeans would be picking the team to lead the nation out of the Covid-19 crisis.

""We are selecting candidates for the next term of Parliament and, in turn, also selecting the party to form the next government. I trust that Singaporeans will take this decision very seriously,"" he said during the virtual briefing which has become the norm of late.

The PAP is bringing in ""more new faces from different segments of our society"" who can represent and bring different interests for discussion, he added, describing the coming slate of candidates as ""very interesting and diverse"".

Coming online a day after President Halimah Yacob dissolved Parliament, the six-minute clip features a diverse slate of men and women, including familiar faces such as outgoing Aljunied GRC MPs Sylvia Lim and Pritam Singh, who is also WP chief, as well as outgoing Non-Constituency MPs Dennis Tan and Leon Perera.

Former Punggol East MP Lee Li Lian, 41, along with two members of the team that contested the Nee Soon GRC in 2015, sales consultant Cheryl Loh and Aljunied-Hougang Town Council councillor Kenneth Foo, 43, also lend their faces and voices to the video.

The others are new faces who have not been formally unveiled but have been seen at WP events.

They are economist Jamus Lim, 44; social activist Raeesah Khan, 27; lawyer Fadli Fawzi, who is a town councillor at the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council; advertising executive Nicole Seah, 33, who was a National Solidarity Party candidate in the 2011 election; and environmental geographer Yudhishthra Nathan.

Urging Singaporeans to ""make your vote count"", the party members recount their memories of growing up in Singapore, talk about their outreach and efforts on the ground over the years, and highlight the need for more diversity in Parliament.

Much of what is shared are personal reflections.

Ms Khan, who helps out at Meet-the-People sessions as a case writer, said it taught her about the different worries of residents.

She says: ""I think one of the myths in volunteering with WP is that everything is political. This is not the case at all.""

And residents, while initially guarded, are warm and receptive, they say.

Ms Seah recounts how a resident once ran at volunteers with an umbrella while they were out on a house visit.

""We literally thought he was going to attack us,"" she said. But he opened the umbrella and they saw it was emblazoned with the WP logo.

""He was trying to show his support,"" she said.

Ms Seah also pays tribute to WP volunteers for their dedication, saying their efforts in helping out with weekly house visits, walkabouts and other party events have kept her going on a personal level.

While former WP chief Low Thia Khiang, the longest-serving opposition MP in Parliament, does not make a speaking appearance on the video, he is in clips from previous occasions.

Mr Low, 63, was recently discharged from Khoo Teck Puat Hospital after a bad fall in April, and is recovering at home.

The Workers' Party GE2020: Make Your Vote Count follows a 15-second teaser clip that the party uploaded on its social media channels on Tuesday evening.

It also comes before WP is to begin formally introducing candidates today.

The two slickly produced videos are a sign of WP's online strategy in an election where Internet campaigning is expected to play a bigger part, given the safe distancing rules to prevent Covid-19 infections.

Mass rallies are out, and political parties will also have to scale back the scope of their walkabouts in constituencies.

Many will be turning to cyberspace and social media to get their message across to the electorate.

Each candidate will also get airtime on national television.

In calling for the electorate to vote, Mr Singh said: ""Not everything is black and white. When it's too bright, it becomes too blinding for anyone to see properly. Too dark, it will be hard to look for a way around.""

What the WP hopes, said Mr Singh, is to create contrast. ""A balance, so that you can see clearly the road ahead.""",0.33782196969696965,0.05611742424242426,Positive

And that is what the Government will be seeking at the July 10 election, labour chief Ng Chee Meng said on Wednesday (June 24).

He said: ""Like Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said, it's an important thing for us to do, so that we get the people's mandate and deal with the issues ahead.""

Mr Ng, who is a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and has been an MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC since 2015, added: ""There will be challenges. So, I think when things are stabilised, we should take this opportunity to seek the mandate from the people to move forward.""

Mr Ng was speaking at Anchorvale Community Club on the sidelines of the launch of a programme that gives out computers to students from low-income families.

He is expected to lead the PAP team in the new Sengkang GRC in the coming polls.

He was joined at the event by Senior Minister of State for Transport and Health Lam Pin Min, who is outgoing MP for Sengkang West.

With them was lawyer Raymond Lye, who is the chairman of Punggol East Citizens' Consultative Committee.

The four-member GRC, which has 120,166 voters, comprises parts of the existing Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, as well as the single seat of Punggol East and parts of Sengkang West.

The move to form the new Sengkang GRC was widely anticipated, given that the area's population has swelled in recent years.

The new GRC is also expected to be contested by the Workers' Party, which held Punggol East from 2013 to 2015 and has also been walking the ground in Sengkang.

On Wednesday, about 20 refurbished computers - donated by charity RSVP Singapore - were given out to students to kickstart the programme.

Called Sengkang Goes Digital, the initiative was started by youth volunteers from Punggol East, Sengkang Central and Sengkang West.

They received support from the Community Development and Welfare Funds, RSVP Singapore and Singapore Computer Society.

The initiative aims to help more than 100 primary and secondary school students from low-income families in Sengkang by giving them PCs or laptops.

Mr Lim Cheng Lei, 28, who is chairman of the People's Association's Sengkang Central Youth Network, said the idea for the initiative came about during the Covid-19 circuit breaker period, when students stayed home from school and had to do home-based learning.

The IT professional said: ""We hope this will give students the opportunity to have an equal playing field... and hopefully, it will open up new doors because with the advancement of technology, you have more opportunities to learn new things online.

""We also hope it will expose them to more knowledge, and maybe (inspire them) to come up with new great ideas and contribute to society.""",0.39519074675324684,0.1307224025974026,Positive

Party secretary-general and founder Lim Tean posted on Facebook on Wednesday (June 24) that it has many candidates but decided on the two constituencies to avoid clashing with other opposition parties.

However, his announcement comes the day after the Singapore Democratic Alliance made clear it will contest only Pasir Ris-Punggol, where it has stood against the People's Action Party (PAP) over the last three elections, starting in 2006.

PV will face PAP in Punggol West.

Mr Lim's announcement on Wednesday follows comments made on June 19, when he said his party was planning to contest Jurong GRC.

On Tuesday, he said that PV was resuming its outreach in the single-seat wards of Mountbatten and Pioneer as well as in Pasir Ris-Punggol and Jalan Besar GRCs.

The party has not announced its candidates yet.

In his Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr Lim, a lawyer, called for volunteers.

""Peoples Voice is blessed with so many outstanding candidates, fired with passion to serve the interests of our people.

The line-up this time included two former civil servants and two candidates from the private sector.

In a virtual press conference streamed from the PAP headquarters in New Upper Changi Road, Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli highlighted how two of them - Ms Hany Soh Hui Bin, a director at MSC Law Corporation, and Mr Don Wee Boon Hong, a senior vice-president at UOB - have taken unconventional educational paths before establishing successful careers.

Ms Soh, 33, said she came from the Normal (Academic) stream at Bendemeer Secondary School. She later obtained a diploma in law and management from a polytechnic, and worked as a paralegal before saving enough money to pursue a law degree overseas.

She said her secondary school teacher advised her that if she became a lawyer someday, she should serve ""the lost, the least and the last"".

This, she said, became her ethos in life and inspired her to get involved in grassroots work. For the last nine years, she has volunteered in Bukit Panjang, helping Bukit Panjang MP Teo Ho Pin.

Ms Soh, who has a 16-month-old daughter, set up the first community legal clinic in a Residents' Committee centre in the area. She said she hopes to increase community awareness of legal issues, like the importance of lasting power of attorney, and make legal help more accessible, such as to those who are physically disabled.

Mr Wee, 43, grew up in a rental flat and made the cut to enter junior college after finishing his O levels at Nan Hua High School. However, money was tight so he decided to enrol in a diploma programme in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, so that he could start work early and help his family with the bills.

After completing his National Service, Mr Wee joined a local bank as a non-executive staff member, and earned an accounting degree after some years of part-time study.

He later qualified as a chartered accountant and completed two Masters' programmes, including a Master in Public Administration from Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

Speaking in Mandarin, he said: ""I'm grateful to have grown up in a meritocratic society - no matter what our individual background or starting point may be, if we have a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, we can ourselves shape our future.

Mr Wee, who has two children, is also a member of the Institute of Mental Health's Visitors' Board. He said he hopes to help the less-privileged, as well as those with mental health problems.

His experience in the banking sector, he said, has also given him more insight into the tremendous challenges small- and medium-sized enterprises face amid the Covid-19 situation. He added that he hopes to help this group of businesses as well.

Said Mr Wee: ""I hope that...politics (can be) an extension of my volunteerism, and a platform for me to raise (residents') concerns and needs to the policymakers.""

Mr Masagos said: ""Don, to me, like Hany, epitomises what I call SkillsFuture now - the journey they've gone through in their school life... does not define where they are and where they can be.""

Mr Wee has been a grassroots leader in West Coast for sixteen years. Both Mr Wee and Ms Soh are fluent in Mandarin, Hokkien and Cantonese.

Mr Masagos also introduced former army colonel Mohd Fahmi Aliman, 48, who stepped down as deputy chief executive of the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore in March. He helped to form and steer the M³@Bedok initiative, launched last year to help the Malay/Muslim community in Bedok Town.

Related Story Singapore GE2020: PAP unveils first slate of candidates for July 10 general election

Mr Fahmi, a father of four, joined the National Trades Union Congress' Administration and Research Unit in April. Before that, he spent 26 years in the Singapore Armed Forces.

His late father was a gas checker, while his late mother worked as a cleaner. When he was in primary school, he would help her clear rubbish, he said. She later upgraded her skills to become a cook in a factory.

That is why, said Mr Fahmi, the welfare of low-wage workers in essential services is close to his heart. ""I hope to become the conduit for my residents to learn new skills, understand what is the training available out there and continue to upskill themselves.""

The fourth candidate at the session was Mr Yip Hon Weng, 43, the former group chief of the Silver Generation Office under the Agency for Integrated Care.

Mr Yip, who is married with five children, received the Public Service Commission Overseas Specialist Award and started his civil service career as a physical education and mathematics teacher.

He later took on roles in policy and management in the education, manpower and defence ministries in the 2000s. He also helped to set up and run the Municipal Services Office - work that involved working closely with various government agencies.

Mr Yip said his stint as a teacher taught him of the need to have empathy for others, and he plans to focus on things like helping to improve aged care services in Singapore.

One incident he remembers vividly, he said, was when he disciplined a student who repeatedly failed to hand in his homework in his first few weeks as a teacher.

However, he later found out that the student came from a poor family, and had to work part-time after school. That is why he did not have the time nor energy to focus on his school work, but he was too embarrassed to tell anyone.

Mr Yip said: ""That day, I learnt that it is very important to always ask and seek to understand the situation before we come to any conclusions about how others behave.""

This sense of empathy has helped him in his career as a teacher and civil servant, he added. ""This is how I will also continue to listen to the concerns of residents as a candidate.""

Mr Masagos said one common quality among PAP candidates is that they never stop learning, and that they have the desire to give back to society. Their actions give an insight into how committed they are in working for the community.

He said: ""Do not just light your own candle - light a thousand candles before your light goes out,"" he said.

DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, REPRESENTING DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF SOCIETY

At an earlier event on Wednesday (June 24), Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat introduced the party's first four candidates for next month's polls.

He said the latest crop of new PAP candidates are a ""very interesting and diverse"" group who have taken multiple pathways to achieve success.

He added that party renewal is part of the process through which the PAP improves its ability to better serve Singaporeans and take the country forward.

Speaking at a virtual press meeting, Mr Heng said: ""What has been very encouraging for us is that we have now seen many Singaporeans who have taken the opportunity of embarking on very different pathways, whether it is education or in their career aspirations, or in the courses they are interested in, and being able to make headway to develop themselves fully in this process.

""What is even more encouraging is that many of them have decided to step forward, so that they can share these experiences, they can continue this process of enabling more Singaporeans to succeed in the coming years.""

Mr Heng said the party's new faces represent different segments of society, and therefore bring with them different issues and concerns to raise in Parliament.

On Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's decision to hold the election now, Mr Heng said Singapore will face many external challenges in the years ahead. Many critical decisions have to be made, and the strategy and action Singapore takes in the coming months will profoundly shape its future, he added.

This is why the decision was taken to hold the election on July 10, he said.

Mr Heng added that the PAP will contest all 93 seats in the polls. For this election, there are a total of 17 GRCs and 14 single-member constituencies.

He said: ""We need to build the adaptive capacity of our society to overcome this crisis and to emerge stronger, so that we can have the ideas and creative energies of all our people to work together on a common purpose.""",0.36845485915051124,0.10605765731852689,Positive

Mr Heng, who is the party's first assistant secretary-general, said Covid-19 has placed incredible stresses on societies, shocking economies deeply and accelerating structural changes, and Singapore needed to build its adaptive capacities in order to emerge stronger.

There are many critical decisions to be made, and the coming months will profoundly shape Singapore's future, he said at a press conference unveiling the party's first slate of four candidates.

The PAP is bringing in ""more new faces from different segments of our society, so that they can represent different segments of society and can bring different interests for discussion"", he added, describing the coming slate of candidates as ""very interesting and diverse"".

Among the first slate of candidates are:

- Former People's Association chief executive director Desmond Tan Kok Ming, 50

For Mr Desmond Tan, securing a government scholarship in his teens was the only way he could afford his university education.

But such social mobility among children from low-income families has become “quite challenging” in recent years, he told reporters on Wednesday.

It is a cause that the father of three plans to champion if he is elected under the banner of the ruling People’s Action Party.

“I would like to be able to continue to make sure that national-level policies look after this group of people... to level the playing field in terms of their education and growing-up needs,” he said.

“The second thing I would like to do is help to make sure that the implementation – the last-mile delivery to households – is also done well in the community.”

Mr Tan grew up in a three-room Bukit Ho Swee flat which at one point housed 12 people – his own family of six, his uncle’s family of four, his grandmother, and another uncle.

His father was a taxi driver, while his mother took on various jobs to supplement the family’s income. These included working in a factory, as a baby-sitter, and selling satay and nasi lemak on the streets.

“I learnt at a very young age that we should take nothing for granted,” he said. “Whether it was the roof over my head, the three meals on the table, or the hand-me-down books and uniforms that I got, my parents and my loved ones worked very hard to provide.”

Mr Tan was from Queenstown Secondary Technical School – now renamed Queenstown Secondary School – and later went to Raffles Junior College.

After serving his national service, he was awarded the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Merit Scholarship. In 1994, he graduated with first class honours in aeronautical engineering from the Victoria University of Manchester.

During his 28 years there, he was deployed to Afghanistan and helped coordinate the organisation’s disaster relief efforts in the Philippines, Nepal and Kota Kinabalu. He also organised several National Day Parades.

Mr Tan rose to the rank of brigadier-general before leaving to helm the People’s Association (PA) in January 2017. There, he introduced Residents’ Networks and Youth Networks to encourage social mixing.

He said he is passionate about social mobility, partly because he benefited from the system. “But also, I do see that in the last few years, this is becoming quite challenging even as our society progresses. I think to sustain social mobility is going to be a big challenge going forward.”

During the press conference, Mr Tan was also asked for his thoughts on speculation that he has been earmarked for a Cabinet position.

“I think I’m not going to get ahead of myself,” he replied. “We should not take for granted that we will be elected.”

- Mr Edward Chia Bing Hui, 36, the co-founder and managing director of lifestyle company Timbre Group

One of Mr Edward Chia’s top priorities – if he is elected to Parliament – is helping small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) transform and ride out the Covid-19 crisis.

The entrepreneur knows first hand the challenges businesses have faced during the past few months, when safe distancing restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus kept customers home.

His own business, Timbre Group, which runs food and beverage venues including Timbre+ and Yishun Park Hawker Centre, has also had to deal with common challenges SMEs have had to grapple with – coping with high rentals, insufficient manpower, and staying ahead of digital disruption.

“I go through this on a daily basis,” he says. “I can truly empathise with SMEs and I hope to be an effective voice for SMEs in Parliament.”

He has had to think of ways to ensure livelihoods of his employees were not overly affected by Covid-19 during the circuit breaker period, pointing out that Timbre had held livestreamed performances on Facebook to help musicians who perform at the company’s various venues.

“As a business owner that’s my fundamental responsibility, which is to protect our livelihoods of our people... because every one of them has a family,” said Mr Chia, the father of a six-year-old boy.

He was one of eight prospective candidates for the PAP unveiled on Wednesday (June 24), and is expected to be fielded in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC.

Mr Heng, who introduced him, said he had first met Mr Chia at a lunch function by the National Youth Achievement Advisory Council, where the latter was making a presentation.

He had been so intrigued by what Mr Chia said, he invited him to speak to Ministry of Education officials, as the ministry then had an initiative to encourage students to take different paths to success.

Mr Chia, who went to National Junior College and studied economics and political science at the National University of Singapore, had started Timbre at 21 when he was an undergraduate.

He is also the co-chair of the Youth Action Plan, and helped craft a youth vision for Singapore.

Said Mr Chia: “We must redouble our efforts to support our SMEs, not just to survive, but to emerge stronger. In essence, stronger SMEs means better jobs for Singaporeans.”

- Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin, 30, associate director at TSMP Law Corporation

Half of Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin’s life has revolved around giving back to the community, starting when she was 15 years old.

At the time, she volunteered with the South East Community Development Council, moving on to focus on causes helping vulnerable women and children.

The lawyer, who is married but does not have children, recounted how she once received a call from a child she was mentoring. The girl, whose parents were in prison, had to go to school to take a test. However, her Ez-link card was out of money.

That incident prompted Ms Nadia to set up the Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud Top-up Fund to make sure such children have enough money for transport.

Ms Nadia, the youngest of the new faces that will be unveiled by the PAP, went to Victoria Junior College and read law at the Singapore Management University.

Apart from her community work, she also serves as a panel advisor for the Youth Court, where her role is to advise judges on the appropriate orders to pass in cases involving children and young persons.

“What means a lot to me is being a safe space for those who may not have many other options to turn to,” she said. “I have worked with elderly who have no family to call, and young women in difficult circumstances – teenage mums, girls who have both parents in prison. Being able to gain their trust, that they will call me before things get really bad, I am grateful.”

Ms Nadia, a recreational diver, has also seen first-hand the havoc wrought by climate change on the natural environment and hopes to champion this cause.

“I hope to be a voice for my generation,” she said. “We value sustainability, and not just in the traditional sense, but also thinking about sustainable economic growth, that is, equitable, first and foremost, while preserving the environment and upholding the values of Singapore.”

Apart from speaking in English and Malay during Wednesday’s press conference, Ms Nadia also spoke a few words in Mandarin. She decided to take Chinese lessons for two years as a child, after several incidents where people would address her in the language, assuming she was Chinese.

This skill has come in handy over the years, she said.

“I think it’s really about that personal connection and being able to say a few things so that people know that you understand where they’re coming from.”

- Mr Ivan Lim Shaw Chuan, 42, general manager (specialised vessels) of Keppel Offshore & Marine

At the age of 16, Mr Ivan Lim had gone to work at Keppel Shipyard after his ‘O’ Levels in 1994, instead of furthering his studies.

“I remember on my first day, the shipyard uncles were asking me, ‘What are you doing here in the shipyard, you should be studying’,” he said.

But for Mr Lim, who was then living in a rental flat in Henderson with his family, circumstances were such that he had “no choice but to start working”.

He worked hard and was awarded a scholarship by Keppel to study for a diploma at Singapore Polytechnic, after which he continued to pursue his degree in Marine Engineering, graduating with first class honours at University of Newcastle Upon Tyne.

Rising through the ranks, the 42-year-old is now general manager at Keppel Offshore & Marine.

“Thinking back. I’m grateful to all my mentors who have helped me along the way,” said Mr Lim, who was introduced to the media by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat as one of the PAP’s new candidates at the upcoming GE.

For Mr Lim, who had a fishmonger father and a mother who worked as a babysitter to supplement the family’s income, his humble beginnings have taught him to treasure opportunities and not take things for granted.

“I chose to serve with PAP, because the party values and attributes are close to my heart. In particular, being compassionate, and also being self reliant,” said the father of four.

The prospective candidate also said he has been volunteering in various capacities since his teens, but over the past year has been active in constituency work at the Henderson-Dawson constituency in Tanjong Pagar GRC.

Now he wants to pay it forward to others who are in need of assistance, saying: “I’m concerned about elderly residents and children who require social assistance, especially those with special needs.”

He is expected to be fielded in Jurong GRC, and said he joined politics because he saw how MPs mobilised resources to help people.

“I’ve learned that in order to help more and extend outreach to benefit more residents, it is important to be able to come up with programmes, work with the people, listen carefully to what people need and then mobilise the necessary resources,” he said.",0.42928547729642624,0.10776226814547984,Positive

At a breakfast meeting at Tiong Bahru Market, Dr Tan presented Mr Lee Hsien Yang with a membership card.

Dr Tan said that Mr Lee has been a member ""for quite some time"", but due to the Covid-19 situation, they were unable to have a proper membership card presentation ceremony.

""This morning, I have a great pleasure in giving this Progress Singapore Party membership card to Lee Hsien Yang, who joined us quite some time ago.""

Mr Lee turned up at 8.30am at the market with Dr Tan and a group of PSP members, all of them wearing the party's red-and-white polo T-shirt.

The Straits Times had reported earlier on Wednesday that Mr Lee had joined the party but party sources said he was unlikely to be fielded as a candidate at the election. Mr Lee reportedly joined the party two months ago, just before the circuit breaker.

Asked if he would be standing for elections, Mr Lee replied: ""When I'm ready to disclose that, you will find out.""

“I joined the party because I think that Dr Tan is committed to doing the right thing for Singapore and Singaporeans and he loves the country. And he has brought together a group of people who share his vision, and it is a vision which I believe will build a better Singapore,” said Mr Lee.

He said that issues such as income inequality, housing and governance and transparency, need to be dealt with, and noted that “the PSP has an approach that emphasises compassion”.

Dr Tan was similarly coy about whether Mr Lee would contest the polls: “I’m not confirming... Don’t worry. In politics, we know when to make our move. Timing is important.”

He noted that there were many ways Mr Lee could contribute to the party. “He is not just an ordinary person. His father is the founder of Singapore, you know, so that’s very important. And the fact he has decided to join us is a clear indication that the current (Government) didn’t follow what his dad wanted.”

Later in the evening, Mr Lee appeared in a brief online broadcast, appealing to Singaporeans to volunteer with the PSP and to donate generously.

“The PAP has lost its way. My sister Wei Ling shares this view too. In fact, she said so in a Facebook post in August 2016 before Oxleygate... It’s possible to be loyal Singaporeans, to be proud of what has been accomplished in the past, to recite with pride ‘we the citizens of Singapore’, to love Singapore and yet to not vote PAP,” Mr Lee said

Mr Lee has been embroiled in a long-running feud with PM Lee over the fate of their father’s house in Oxley Road.

Mr Lee’s emergence comes a day after Parliament was dissolved and the Writ of Election was issued. Nomination Day will be on June 30, with Polling Day on July 10.

Dr Tan said on Wednesday that he thought the timing of the election was “irresponsible” and potentially puts a lot of the elderly into a dangerous situation.

“The signs are there, it is so clear. And if they don’t want to heed the signs then the price they have to pay, as I said before, they might win this battle but they are going to lose the war.”

Dr Tan has said on multiple occasions that he and Mr Lee Hsien Yang are good friends and that if Mr Lee wants to join PSP, it would have to be on the terms of the party.

The duo have been spotted before on several occasions having breakfast together, once at a hawker centre in the Prime Minister’s ward.

In July last year, Mr Lee Hsien Yang said on Facebook: “I wholeheartedly support the principles and values of the Progress Singapore Party.”

In a highly personal Facebook post, Dr Yaacob, 64, thanked colleagues, grassroots leaders and fellow MPs, and said that he was ""blessed"" to have known so many residents in his Kolam Ayer ward in Jalan Besar GRC. He said: ""Some whom I met as children have grown into proud parents, while others have left us, leaving behind their legacies in the constituency. I have grown with them, becoming one of them as their friend.

""I thank them all for opening their doors and hearts to me, allowing me to enter a world full of warmth, camaraderie and spirit. During all those years, my race never mattered to them.""

He also thanked his grassroots leaders, People's Association staff, colleagues in his group representation constituency and the various ministries he has served in, as well as his fellow parliamentarians.

He said: ""As I turn to the next chapter of my life, I will always cherish these past 23 years for the friends I have made and the opportunities it gave me during many trials and tribulations to become a better person.""

Dr Yaacob first hinted at his departure from politics during the Budget debate in February, when he suggested that it would be his last.

With a PhD in engineering from Stanford University, he taught at the National University of Singapore for several years before entering Parliament in 1997.

He was an MP for Jalan Besar GRC until 2011, when Kolam Ayer was absorbed into Moulmein-Kallang GRC and he led the People's Action Party team to victory there.

In April 2001, he became the first mayor of Central District. In 2003, he became minister for community development and sports, as well as minister-in-charge of Muslim affairs - a post he held until 2018. From 2004 to 2011, he held the portfolio of environment minister, which was later expanded to include water resources.

Dr Yaacob is among several veteran MPs expected to step down in the coming election.

Emeritus Senior Minister and former prime minister Goh Chok Tong, and former Cabinet ministers Lim Swee Say, Lim Hng Kiang and Lee Yi Shyan are also expected to leave politics in the run-up to the polls.

FRIENDSHIPS FORGED Some whom I met as children have grown into proud parents, while others have left us, leaving behind their legacies in the constituency. I have grown with them, becoming one of them as their friend. I thank them all for opening their doors and hearts to me, allowing me to enter a world full of warmth, camaraderie and spirit. DR YAACOB IBRAHIM

Dr Yaacob, Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Lim Hng Kiang stepped down from the Cabinet in 2018. At an appreciation dinner for them, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Dr Yaacob, at critical moments such as after the Sept 11, 2001 terror attacks, ""provided crucial leadership for the Malay/Muslim community at a moment of anxiety and uncertainty"".

He added: ""I have no doubt that Yaacob's firmness exposed him to criticism, and came at some cost to his personal popularity. But Yaacob held firm, and in doing so, made a vital contribution to maintaining our racial and religious harmony.""

Mr Goh, in a cryptic Facebook post earlier yesterday, wrote: ""Parliament dissolved. Quo vadis, Singapore? Quo vadis, me?""

Mr Tan made the remarks in a Facebook post that also featured a photo of the two men, both wearing face masks.

Mr Low, 63, injured his head in a fall on April 30. He was admitted to the intensive care unit of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, and discharged after 21 days.

Mr Tan, whose post comes after what appears to be a visit to Mr Low's home, said he had kept in touch with Mr Low since his fall.

He wrote: ""Glad to see Mr Low again. Have kept in touch with him since his fall and am glad to see him in good spirits and recovering. Had a nice long chat on a range of topics.""

Mr Tan also thanked Mr Low for tea and bak chang, or rice dumplings. ""Hope you like the durian and pears, too,"" he added.

The veteran politician is the former secretary-general of the WP, and an outgoing MP for Aljunied GRC. The other outgoing WP MPs in Aljunied GRC had been covering Mr Low's constituency duties after his fall, with help from former Non-Constituency MP Gerald Giam.

Mr Low is the longest-serving opposition MP in Singapore. He entered politics in 1988, and stood for election as a WP candidate in Tiong Bahru GRC but did not win. In 1991, he won the Hougang single-member seat, and has been an MP since.

In 2001, Mr Low took over as WP secretary-general from Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, and led the party for 17 years before stepping down two years ago.

His successor is outgoing Aljunied GRC MP Pritam Singh.

It is unclear if Mr Low will stand for election again in the upcoming polls, which will be held on July 10.

The party had subsequently trimmed the list to 29, saying it was giving up some seats after discussions with other opposition parties to avoid three-cornered fights.

Yesterday, party chief Tan Cheng Bock, 80, disclosed during a Zoom meeting that the PSP intends to contest two five-member group representation constituencies - West Coast and Tanjong Pagar - the four-member Chua Chu Kang GRC, and five single-member constituencies: Hong Kah North, Pioneer and the newly formed Marymount, Yio Chu Kang and Kebun Baru seats.

While the former People's Action Party MP and 2011 presidential candidate did not mention five-member Nee Soon GRC, he said on Sunday during a walkabout in Chong Pang that the PSP was considering contesting the GRC. He said yesterday: ""We select the areas we want to contest based on whether we can win and there are certain places I'm quite familiar with... so we concentrate on the western side (of Singapore).

""Of course, on Nomination Day, things change. Politics is very fluid.""

Dr Tan also unveiled six more candidates for the July 10 polls, five of whom will be contesting their first election. The party introduced its first slate of six candidates last Thursday.

""My party is not a one-man party, it is not just a one-constituency party. The party will back every member,"" said Dr Tan.

The six new faces are:

• Mr Choo Shaun Ming, 23, a National University of Singapore law undergraduate who is the PSP's youngest candidate;

• Dr Tan Meng Wah, 57, a former Institute of Policy Studies research fellow, whose interests include income inequality;

• Mr Abas Kasmani, 67, a business consultant and senior trainer;

• Ms Kayla Low, 43, a chartered accountant and former prisons officer who volunteers with low-income families and the elderly;

• Mr Harish Pillay, 60, global head of community architecture and leadership at software firm Red Hat; and

• Dr Ang Yong Guan, 65, a psychiatrist who stood in the 2011 General Election as a Singapore Democratic Party candidate, and in the 2015 polls under Singaporeans First party where he was the chairman.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock did not indicate where the candidates will stand, but Mr Abas is one of two names tipped to take the final slot in the five-person West Coast team.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock was a PAP MP for 26 years, from 1980, in single-seat Ayer Rajah, which was absorbed into West Coast GRC in 2006. He is expected to lead the team there in the coming polls.

Meanwhile, Dr Ang was seen at Shunfu Mart Food Centre in Marymount SMC on Sunday and Dr Tan Meng Wah and Mr Choo were both present at PSP's walkabout in Teck Whye Lane, which is part of Chua Chu Kang GRC.

Dr Tan Meng Wah later put up an image on Facebook featuring himself, Mr Choo and two PSP central executive committee members: former air force colonel Francis Yuen, 70, and engineer Abdul Rahman Mohamad, who has yet to be formally unveiled as a candidate.

Mr Choo said he did not see his youth as a disadvantage.

Citing Scottish National Party MP Mhairi Black, who was elected at 20, and Emirati politician Shamma Al Mazrui who was made a Cabinet minister at 22, he said: ""Young people all over the world have shown that they can make a difference.""",0.27672912801484234,0.08343846629560914,Positive

Out of the drawer came their battle plans as they shrugged off the months-long standby because of the global pandemic.

Covid-19 had thrown a spanner in the works as social distancing measures put the brakes on preparations.

In the early months of this year, the PAP had revved up its election machinery after the Government announced the new electoral boundaries in March.

Potential candidates began to be more visible on the ground, shadowing incumbent MPs, as the party started to position its people for the electoral battle.

But everything was put on hold when infection numbers spiked in the foreign workers' dormitories and the country entered an eight-week circuit breaker shutdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Former PAP MP Inderjit Singh said the party had been ready for a contest as early as April or last month.

Now, the PAP branches in each constituency are swiftly moving into high gear again for the short but intense electioneering.

""The manifestos are probably all ready, so are the posters and the nine-day campaign plan. Now, it is about executing the plan,"" Mr Singh said.

With the writ issued and Singapore in phase two of its economic reopening, activists say they are raring to go again.

""We've been walking the ground since the last GE (general election) ended (in September 2015), so residents already know and recognise us. But of course, we cannot take things for granted and slow down. The ground campaign may not be as demanding but we will still have to go house to house,"" said an activist.

This time, limits on physical campaigning means candidates will be reaching out more actively to voters in cyberspace.

Related Story Singapore General Election 2020: Singaporeans will go to the polls on July 10

For instance, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong and his Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC team are launching a series of live chats with residents on Facebook today.

With an economic recession looming and rising job losses on the horizon, party activists and analysts said they are expecting a ""flight to safety"" by voters, who will likely turn to PAP, with its experience, to steer Singapore through the storm.

Said Mr Singh: ""The ground is not sweet, it is worried about the future, and because people are worried, they will not vote recklessly.""

Other activists said their sense of the ground sentiment is that people are generally satisfied with the fiscal support - four Budgets amounting to almost $93 billion - that the Government has marshalled to fight Covid-19, support businesses and keep Singaporeans employed.

""There might be a lot of migrant workers infected but people can see that not many Singaporeans have been stricken by the bug. At the same time, they can see all the schemes that are available to help them,"" noted another activist.

In the face of the public health and economic crisis, the PAP activists interviewed believe their party could match its result in the 2015 General Election.

That year, with the election held amid the 50th anniversary of Singapore's independence and six months after founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew died, the PAP won with almost 70 per cent of the popular vote.

Previous crisis elections had yielded similarly high vote shares. For instance, in the 2001 GE that was held soon after the Sept 11 terror attacks, the PAP got 75.3 per cent of the popular vote.

Institute of Policy Studies deputy director for research Gillian Koh noted that the party leaders in Government had used the series of six ministerial broadcasts this month to emphasise to voters that they have the wherewithal to shepherd not just Singapore's short-term recovery, but also its longer-term social and economic progress.

""The PAP, even with its new recruits, will try to emphasise it has a team that has the smarts, the experience and commitment to lead the country out (of the crisis) and generate sustained progress for the future,"" said Dr Koh.

She pointed out that many incumbent MPs and potential candidates had also kept busy during the circuit breaker period, building their online presence and gearing up for the battle in cyberspace.

In a Facebook post yesterday, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing said the Government will continue to put the interests of Singaporeans ""front and centre"".

""This will be a very different general election. We are holding one in exceedingly difficult circumstances, at a time when Singapore and Singaporeans are facing the most serious health and economic challenges of this generation,"" he said.

This election, however, has another layer of importance for the ruling party: leadership transition.

The fourth-generation leadership is set to take over in the next term of government, as fresh blood is being brought in to take the place of senior ministers retiring from politics.

Among those expected to step aside are political veterans such as Mr Khaw Boon Wan from Sembawang GRC; Mr Lim Hng Kiang from West Coast GRC; Mr Lim Swee Say from East Coast GRC; and Dr Yaacob Ibrahim from Jalan Besar GRC.

But with Covid-19, the party has not had the same runway to officially introduce its new candidates - traditionally done at press conferences leading up to the issuance of the Writ of Election.

Still, activists said plans are afoot to do so in the next few days.

Among the prospective candidates are top public servants who have stepped down from their posts recently, signalling they could enter politics in the coming polls. Some of them include:

•Former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43, who is tipped to be fielded in East Coast GRC, where two outgoing MPs - Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Lee Yi Shyan - are expected to leave.

•Former air force brigadier-general Gan Siow Huang, 45, who is now deputy CEO of the National Trades Union Congress' Employment and Employability Institute, and is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

•Former brigadier-general Desmond Tan, 49, who left his post as People's Association chief executive earlier this month, and could be part of the PAP's team in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

•Former group chief of the Silver Generation Office under the Agency for Integrated Care Yip Hon Weng, 43, who could be fielded in the new Yio Chu Kang single seat.

New faces from the private sector have also featured prominently in virtual discussions with residents and grassroots leaders in the past few months. They include:

•Changi Airport Group vice-president Poh Li San, 45, who has been active in Sembawang GRC.

•Lawyer Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, 39, who is expected to be fielded in Chua Chu Kang GRC.

•Polytechnic senior lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 41, who appeared on a webinar with Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and Ms Denise Phua, both of whom are expected to be on the PAP's Jalan Besar GRC slate.

•DBS Bank managing director and head of group audit Derrick Goh, 51, who has been spotted with Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam in Nee Soon GRC.

Activists said that what remains is to make sure candidates' forms are in order, and orders are placed for last-minute campaign materials, including calling cards with candidates' pictures, and Covid-19 essentials such as bottles of hand sanitiser with the party's logo on them.

The Workers' Party (WP), the largest opposition force and the only one which had Parliament seats, is facing its first election with a new secretary-general since 2001, with Mr Low Thia Khiang having handed the reins in 2018 to Mr Pritam Singh. It is also unclear if the party's biggest personality will contest the election after suffering a fall that landed him in hospital earlier this year.

For the first time since 1976, there will also be no candidate named Chiam on the ballot, as both opposition veteran Chiam See Tong and his wife Lina Chiam are sitting out the contest.

At the same time, there has been an influx of new parties since the last election, with Dr Tan Cheng Bock's Progress Singapore Party (PSP) the most significant newcomer.

A record 12 opposition parties could be vying for seats in the 2020 General Election, now that PSP, the newly registered Red Dot United and Peoples Voice (PV) are joining the WP, Singapore People's Party (SPP), Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), National Solidarity Party (NSP), People's Power Party (PPP), Singaporeans First (SingFirst), Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), Reform Party (RP) and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

The crowded field of political parties and a decision to proceed without their traditional pow-wow also mean that multiple seats could be headed for three-cornered fights.

Add to the mix the looming uncertainty caused by the global pandemic, the election taking place without the excitement of rallies and an election lead-up that was disrupted by the circuit breaker, and observers say the opposition is heading into the coming election less prepared and less coordinated than the last one.

LEADERSHIP RENEWAL

Outgoing Aljunied GRC MP and former WP chief Mr Low is currently recuperating from a head injury, and it remains to be seen whether he will take part in the next electoral contest. The 63-year-old, who is the longest-serving opposition MP, sustained the injury after a fall at home on April 30, and was warded in the intensive care unit of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Outgoing Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin posted a photo of him with Mr Low yesterday, showing the opposition leader was recovering well.

There is talk of a broader change of guard across the party, with outgoing MPs like Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Png Eng Huat expected to retire.

Mr Chiam has also stepped away from politics after more than four decades, relinquishing his post as secretary-general of the SPP last October. This is the first election in 24 years that the SPP is heading into without Mr Chiam, 85, at the helm. Mrs Chiam, 71, who took over the Potong Pasir contests from him in the past two elections, will also not be fielded this time.

Dr Felix Tan, associate lecturer at SIM Global Education, said that this time round, a lot of the parties have a strong focus on new leaders taking the reins. He cited WP chief, Mr Singh, 43, NSP secretary-general Spencer Ng, 41, and SPP chairman Jose Raymond, 48, as examples of leaders from the new generation.

Related Story GE2020: Live coverage on Singapore General Election

""For those parties that started to hone their new leaders earlier, like the WP with Pritam Singh, there's been a longer lead time of sorts,"" he added.

He also noted that the SDP has been placing chairman Paul Tambyah at the forefront of its activities, with much less of a reliance on secretary-general Chee Soon Juan.

Associate Professor Bilveer Singh, from the National University of Singapore's (NUS) political science department, said, however, that the new leaders are entering the fray at a challenging time. ""It will be interesting to see if the younger leaders can bump up the image of their parties. But they are coming at the wrong time. I think Covid-19 will overwhelm everything.""

IMPACT OF COVID-19

The pandemic has already had a palpable impact on the campaign with political parties having to adjust their usual campaign practices from previous elections, due to campaigning guidelines released by the Elections Department last week.

These include the lack of physical rallies, made up for by allowing candidates running in every constituency to have broadcast opportunities on national television.

More importantly, all the platforms and issues that the parties were intending to campaign on will likely now have to be set aside.

Prof Singh said that most of the issues that dominated headlines before the pandemic struck, such as the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council saga and the issues surrounding the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma), including PV chief Lim Tean's four Pofma notices, are unlikely to be on the minds of voters this time round.

""Fortunately or unfortunately, Covid-19 has closed every major issue. They'll be voting on Covid-19. This is a Covid-19 election. All other issues are secondary. In a crisis, where got time? Maybe some NGOs will start talking about equal wage and environment, but for the majority of Singaporeans it's about bread and butter, about life and death.""

Opposition sources said there is currently no consensus on how parties should attack the issue. While the opposition parties have shown they are willing to criticise the Government over the timing of the election, there have yet to be any sharp attacks on the handling of the pandemic - especially from the larger parties.

Prof Singh said attacking the Government's response to the pandemic will not necessarily resonate with voters.

""Generally, compared to the region and the world, we have done well. We perhaps dropped the ball in some areas like late masking and the dorms, but in general we have done well. Digging into the reserves was a very good move. It's very populist, but it's populism rightly placed at the right time,"" said Prof Singh.

Dr Tan of SIM Global Education said basic issues affecting the daily lives of Singaporeans, beyond just Covid-19, must also be addressed if the parties want to reach voters.

""Unfortunately a lot of issues will revolve around Covid-19, but there should be a focus on GST (goods and services tax) rise, education, housing and transportation. These shouldn't take the back seat. Covid-19 is not something that we can solve in the short term, and there's only so much that we should pursue,"" he said.

""At the end of the day, most Singaporeans will gravitate towards the bread and butter issues, and these are affected by government policies which are within our range of control.""

MORE MULTI-CORNERED FIGHTS?

Traditionally, the opposition parties have all come together ahead of the electoral contest to discuss and come to an agreement about where each party will contest. These horse-trading talks are meant to help them avoid three-cornered fights, which usually end up favouring the incumbent by splitting the opposition votes.

This time round, the mass talks are not happening, replaced instead with smaller direct talks between parties which have clashing claims in constituencies.

While some progress has been made, there are some three-way contests looming.

For example, PSP and RP have both staked claims to West Coast GRC, while PV and SDA both have their eyes on Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC. The newly created Marymount ward has also drawn the interest of the DPP and the PSP, with DPP secretary-general Hamim Aliyas and PSP member Ang Yong Guan bumping into each other during their walkabouts on Sunday.

It remains to be seen whether the parties will come to an agreement to sort out the overlapping claims.

Dr Tan from SIM Global Education said: ""With the increased Non-Constituency MP quota of 12, everyone is vying for a chance to get into Parliament by that path. Some might feel that the best way in is not necessarily to win, but to lose by a small margin.""

IMPACT OF PSP AND NEWCOMERS

Founded by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, a former People's Action Party (PAP) MP, PSP was launched in August last year to much hype due to its secretary-general's star power. In March, the PSP laid claim to 15 constituencies in its first electoral outing.

It was a clear show of force for a new party to announce it would contest nearly half of all seats at its first outing. And while it has since scaled back its plans, the party said it still intends to contest 24 of the 93 available seats.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock was MP of Ayer Rajah for 26 years, a ward which is now part of West Coast GRC. He also ran for the country's presidency in 2011, emerging a close second to eventual winner, Dr Tony Tan. The party has also been publicly supported by Mr Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. It is not yet clear what role Mr Lee Hsien Yang will play.

Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan of the Singapore Management University (SMU) said that if Dr Tan Cheng Bock can assure voters that PSP is more than just him, then the party will live up to its billing as the party to watch in this coming election.

""In webinars, Dr Tan has been very deliberate in having his colleagues take the lead in fielding questions from the audience. He is aware that the party must be larger than him. But we will get to see more of him when the campaign trail starts,"" said Prof Tan.

WHAT ARE THEIR CHANCES?

While opposition leaders publicly express confidence, sources say many are concerned about its chances.

PPP chief Goh Meng Seng said he is quietly confident this time round, but at the same time warned that the opposition does not yet have its tactics right - noting that the different parties have not been pulling in the same direction.

""There's now a jobs crisis due to the economy, and a health crisis due to Covid-19. Usually when there's one of these, people will vote for the PAP. But this double blow has brought doubt over their leadership,"" he said.

""I guess voters will be in a dilemma while voting, and there's a potential for votes to swing either way. Yes, there might be an advantage to the opposition, but we must be tactically careful.""

Prof Tan of SMU said, however, that the ""flight to safety"" that many assume will take place in a crisis cannot be taken for granted.

""Even if the Government has done well in the crisis, this does not necessarily result in a landslide support,"" he said, citing the example of 2011 when the PAP government did well in dealing with the global financial crisis, but still turned in one of its worst electoral performances.

Prof Tan added: ""We are not going into the storm this time. We are already in the eye of the storm. So this may not work in favour of the ruling party because the societal gaps have been shown.""",0.3961522083580907,0.05270265682030389,Positive

The number of seats in the next Parliament will grow from 89 to 93.

The minimum number of opposition MPs, including Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs), will go up from nine to 12, as a result of changes made to the NCMP scheme in 2016.

There are four new single seats: Punggol West, which has been carved out of Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC; Kebun Baru, formerly part of Nee Soon GRC; Marymount, previously from Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC; Yio Chu Kang, which had been part of Ang Mo Kio GRC.

3 KEY BOUNDARY CHANGES

Residents in the Joo Seng area of Marine Parade GRC will move to Potong Pasir SMC, while residents of Lorong 8 Toa Payoh will now vote in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

Fengshan residents are now part of East Coast GRC.

More than half of Sengkang West's residents will join the new four-member Sengkang GRC, with the rest going to Ang Mo Kio GRC.

Punggol East residents will also vote in Sengkang GRC.

4 NO PHYSICAL RALLIES

No police permits will be granted for rallies and no gatherings of supporters will be allowed. Campaigning can be carried out online.

Walkabouts are limited to no more than five people in each group.

No mixing is allowed between groups.

5 CONSTITUENCY POLITICAL BROADCASTS

For the first time, constituency political broadcasts will air on Mediacorp's Channel 5.

Each single-member constituency candidate gets three minutes for these broadcasts.

Each group of GRC candidates gets 12 or 15 minutes, depending on the group representation constituency size.

This is in addition to the two party political broadcasts on 19 TV/radio channels, up from 13 TV/radio channels in 2015.

6 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST FOREIGN INTERFERENCE

Political parties have been told to watch out for foreign interference and cyber-security risks during the election.

7 VOTERS ON STAY-HOME NOTICE

Special polling stations will be set up for people on stay-home notice (SHN) at designated facilities such as hotels.

For other affected voters, such as those serving SHN at home, the Elections Department will consult the Health Ministry to assess the public health risks of allowing them to vote.

8 PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES AT POLLING STATIONS

Voters will be given recommended two-hour time slots to visit polling stations.

Morning slots will be reserved for seniors.

Temperature screening at the stations will sieve out those with fever or respiratory symptoms. Whether these groups will be allowed to vote will depend on the prevailing Covid-19 situation during the polls.

9 SAFER AND SMOOTHER PROCESS FOR CASTING VOTES

New self-inking pens, which will allow voters to easily stamp an ""X"" for the party of their choice, will be used. Cleaners will be deployed at all polling stations to clean items and areas described as ""common touch points"" such as the self-inking pens and polling booths. They will do so at least once every half an hour.",0.33160791589363015,0.023849721706864568,Positive

The widely anticipated announcement of the election date came yesterday, when President Halimah Yacob dissolved Singapore's 13th Parliament and issued the Writ of Election.

Nomination Day will be next Tuesday, with the minimum nine days of campaigning before Cooling-Off Day on July 9.

Polling Day will be on July 10 - a Friday and a public holiday.

In a televised address to the nation yesterday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he has decided to call the general election now, while the Covid-19 situation is relatively stable, to ""clear the decks"" and give the new government a fresh, full five-year mandate.

After the election, the new government can focus on the national agenda - which includes handling the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and jobs - and the difficult decisions it will have to make and to carry, he said.

The alternative is to wait out the pandemic, he said, noting however that there is no assurance the outbreak will be over before the Government's term ends next April, with the virus expected to linger for at least a year - most probably longer - until a vaccine is available.

The election, Singapore's 13th since independence, is likely to see the People's Action Party (PAP) challenged for all seats - as the ruling party was in 2015.

A total of 93 elected seats are at stake - in 17 group representation constituencies and 14 single-member constituencies.

GE2020 will be waged on a drastically different battleground due to the pandemic.

Safe distancing rules that restrict the size of public gatherings to five people mean traditional campaign staples like mass rallies cannot be held. Political parties will also have to scale back on the scope of their walkabouts in constituencies.

They have geared up to turn to cyberspace and social media instead, to get their messages across to the electorate. Each candidate will also get airtime on national television, as part of the new, one-off constituency political broadcasts.

Following the announcement yesterday, political parties sprang into action and ramped up their planning and preparations.

Due to safe distancing restrictions, they ironed out campaign strategies via WhatsApp messages and Zoom calls, instead of traditional meetings in larger groups.

The PAP will launch official introductions of its new candidates and release its party manifesto over the course of this week.

Opposition parties said they were ready for the election, as the possibility of one has been on the cards for some time.

Observers reckon issues that will feature prominently at the hustings include the state of the economy and jobs, the Government's handling of the coronavirus situation, political succession and the setting of the direction of Singapore's future after Covid-19.

The PAP's leaders have, in a series of six national broadcasts over the past two weeks, set out the key issues at stake, including protecting jobs, overcoming the current crisis and securing Singapore's future.

Meanwhile, opposition parties are expected to question the Government's handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, and call for greater accountability as well as more checks and balances to keep the ruling party on its toes.

The pandemic has brought economies to a near standstill, as countries lock down to curb the spread of the virus. Singapore's economy is projected to shrink by up to 7 per cent this year, which would make it the worst recession since independence in 1965.

In response, the Government has rolled out nearly $93 billion to fund four Covid-19 support packages, requiring a draw of up to $52 billion from past reserves.

This coming election will see Mr Lee lead the PAP into battle for the fourth, and what looks set to be the final, time as prime minister.

He had earlier declared his intention to hand over the reins to his successor by the time he turns 70, which will be in 2022.

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who leads the PAP's fourth-generation team, is poised to take over.

The 2006 General Election, the first led by Mr Lee, saw the PAP get 66.6 per cent of the popular vote.

The ruling party saw its vote share fall to 60.1 per cent in the 2011 election, but rebounded to secure 69.9 per cent of the vote in 2015.

There will be 2,653,942 voters heading to the polls next month.

There will also be a minimum of 12 opposition MPs in Parliament - including Non-Constituency MPs - up from nine currently. This stems from changes to the Constitution that were passed to guarantee that number, should there be fewer than 12 elected opposition MPs.

The Returning Officer for this election is Mr Tan Meng Dui, replacing Mr Ng Wai Choong, who was the Returning Officer for the 2015 General Election.

The Workers' Party (WP), the largest opposition force and the only one with Parliament seats, is facing its first election with a new secretary-general since 2001, with Mr Low Thia Khiang having handed the reins in 2018 to Mr Pritam Singh. It is also unclear if the party's biggest personality will contest the election after suffering a fall that landed him in hospital earlier this year.

For the first time since 1976, there will also be no candidate named Chiam on the ballot, as both opposition veteran Chiam See Tong and his wife Lina Chiam are sitting out the contest.

At the same time, there has been an influx of new parties since the last elections, with Dr Tan Cheng Bock's Progress Singapore Party (PSP) the most significant newcomer.

A record 12 opposition parties could be vying for seats in the 2020 General Election. They are:

- WP

- PSP

- Singapore People's Party (SPP)

- Singapore Democratic Party (SDP)

- National Solidarity Party (NSP)

- People's Power Party (PPP)

- Singapore First (SingFirst)

- Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA)

- Reform Party (RP)

- Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)

- Peoples Voice (PV)

- Red Dot United

The crowded field of political parties and a decision to proceed without their traditional pow-wow also mean that multiple seats could be headed for three-cornered fights.

Add to the mix the looming uncertainty caused by the global pandemic, elections taking place without the excitement of rallies and an election lead-up that was disrupted by the circuit breaker, and observers say the opposition is heading into the coming elections less prepared and less coordinated than the last one.

LEADERSHIP RENEWAL

Outgoing Aljunied GRC MP and former WP chief Mr Low is currently recuperating from a head injury, and it remains to be seen whether he will take part in the next electoral contest. The 63-year-old, who is the longest-serving opposition MP, sustained the injury after a fall at home on April 30, and was warded in the intensive care unit of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin posted a photo of him with Mr Low yesterday showing the opposition leader was recovering well.

And there is talk of a broader change of guard across the party, with MPs like Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Png Eng Huat expected to retire.

Mr Chiam has also stepped away from politics after more than four decades, relinquishing his post as secretary-general of the SPP last October. This is the first election in 24 years that the SPP is heading into without Mr Chiam, 85, at the helm. Mrs Chiam, 71, who took over the Potong Pasir contests from him in the past two elections, will also not be fielded this time.

Dr Felix Tan, associate lecturer at SIM Global Education, said that this time round, a lot of the parties have a strong focus on newer leaders taking the reins. He cited WP chief Mr Singh, 43, NSP secretary-general Spencer Ng, 41, and SPP chairman Jose Raymond, 48, as examples of leaders from the new generation.

""For those parties that started to hone their new leaders earlier, like the WP with Pritam Singh, there's been a longer lead time of sorts,"" he added.

He also noted that the SDP has been placing chairman Paul Tambyah at the forefront of its activities, with much less of a reliance on secretary-general Chee Soon Juan.

Associate Professor Bilveer Singh, from the National University of Singapore's (NUS) political science department said, however, that the new leaders are entering the fray at a challenging time. ""It will be interesting to see if the younger leaders can bump up the image of their parties. But they are coming at the wrong time. I think Covid-19 will overwhelm everything.""

IMPACT OF COVID-19

The pandemic has already had a palpable impact on the campaign with political parties having to adjust their usual campaign practices from previous elections, due to campaigning guidelines released by the Elections Department last week.

These include the lack of physical rallies, made up for by allowing candidates running in every constituency to have broadcast opportunities on national television.

More importantly, all the platforms and issues that the parties were intending to campaign on will likely now have to be set aside.

Dr Singh from NUS said that most of the issues that dominated headlines before the pandemic struck, such as the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council saga and the issues surrounding the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (Pofma), including PV chief Lim Tean's four Pofma notices, are unlikely to be on the minds of voters this time round.

""Fortunately or unfortunately, Covid-19 has closed every major issue. They'll be voting on Covid-19. This is a Covid-19 election. All other issues are secondary. In a crisis, where got time? Maybe some NGOs will start talking about equal wage and environment, but for the majority of Singaporeans it's about bread and butter, about life and death.""

Opposition sources say there is currently no consensus on how parties should attack the issue. While the opposition parties have shown they are willing to criticise the Government over the timing of the election, there has yet to be any sharp attacks on the handling of the pandemic - especially from the larger parties.

Prof Singh said that attacking the Government's response to the pandemic will not necessarily resonate with voters.

""Generally, compared to the region and the world, we have done well. We perhaps dropped the ball in some areas like late masking and the dorms, but in general we have done well. Digging into the reserves was a very good move. It's very populist, but it's populism rightly placed at the right time,"" said Prof Singh.

Dr Tan of SIM Global Education said basic issues affecting the daily lives of Singaporeans, beyond just Covid-19, must also be addressed if the parties want to reach voters.

""Unfortunately, a lot of issues will revolve around Covid-19, but there should be a focus on GST (Goods and Services Tax) rise, education, housing and transportation. These shouldn't take the back seat. Covid-19 is not something that we can solve in the short term, and there's only so much that we should pursue,"" he said.

""At the end of the day, most Singaporeans will gravitate towards the bread-and-butter issues, and these are affected by government policies which are within our range of control.""

MORE MULTI-CORNERED FIGHTS?

Traditionally, the opposition parties have all come together ahead of the electoral contest to discuss and come to an agreement about where each party will contest. These horse-trading talks are meant to help them avoid three-cornered fights, which usually end up favouring the incumbent by splitting the opposition votes.

This time round, the mass talks are not happening, replaced instead with smaller direct talks between parties which have clashing claims in constituencies.

While some progress has been made, there are some three-way contests looming.

For example, PSP and RP have both staked claims to West Coast GRC, while PV and SDA both have their eyes on Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC. The newly created Marymount ward has also drawn the interest of the DPP and the PSP, with DPP secretary-general Hamim Aliyas and PSP member Ang Yong Guan bumping into each other during their walkabouts on Sunday.

It remains to be seen whether the parties will come to an agreement to sort out the overlapping claims.

Dr Tan from SIM Global Education said: ""With the increased Non-Constituency MP quota of 12, everyone is vying for a chance to get into Parliament by that path. Some might feel that the best way in is not necessarily to win, but to lose by a small margin.""

IMPACT OF PSP AND NEWCOMERS

Founded by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, a former People's Action Party (PAP) MP, PSP was launched in August last year to much hype due to its secretary-general's star power. In March, the PSP laid claim to 15 constituencies in its first electoral outing.

It was a clear show of force for a new party to announce it would contest nearly half of all seats at its first outing. And while it has since scaled back its plans, the party said it still intends to contest 24 of the 93 available seats.

Dr Tan Cheng Bock was MP of Ayer Rajah for 26 years, a ward which is now part of West Coast GRC. He also ran for the country's presidency in 2011, emerging a close second to eventual winner Tony Tan. The party has also been publicly supported by Mr Lee Hsien Yang, the estranged brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. It is not yet clear what role Mr Lee Hsien Yang will play.

Associate Professor of Law Eugene Tan of the Singapore Management University (SMU) said that if Dr Tan Cheng Bock can assure voters that PSP is more than just him, then the party will live up to its billing as the party to watch in this coming election.

""In webinars, Dr Tan has been very deliberate in having his colleagues take the lead in fielding questions from the audience. He is aware that the party must be larger than him. But we will get to see more of him when the campaign trail starts,"" said Prof Tan.

WHAT ARE THEIR CHANCES?

While opposition leaders publicly express confidence, sources say many are concerned about its chances.

PPP chief Goh Meng Seng said he is quietly confident this time round, but at the same time warned that the opposition does not yet have its tactics right - noting that the different parties have not been pulling in the same direction.

""There's now a jobs crisis due to the economy, and a health crisis due to Covid-19. Usually when there's one of these, people will vote for the PAP. But this double blow has brought doubt over their leadership,"" he said.

""I guess voters will be in a dilemma while voting, and there's a potential for votes to swing either way. Yes, there might be an advantage to the opposition, but we must be tactically careful.""

Prof Tan of SMU said, however, that the ""flight to safety"" that many assume will take place in a crisis cannot be taken for granted.

""Even if the Government has done well in the crisis, this does not necessarily result in a landslide support,"" he said, citing the example of 2011 when the PAP government did well in dealing with the global financial crisis, but still turned in one of its worst electoral performances.

Prof Tan added: ""We are not going into the storm this time. We are already in the eye of the storm. So this may not work in favour of the ruling party because the societal gaps have been shown. Some voters may feel that the PAP did not measure up in certain areas.""",0.3904292235542235,0.052917082917082914,Positive

Out of the drawer came their battle plans as they shrugged off the months-long standby because of the global pandemic. The party introduced its first slates of candidates on Wednesday morning.

Covid-19 had thrown a spanner in the works as social distancing measures put the brakes on preparations.

In the early months of this year, the PAP had revved up its election machinery after the Government announced the new electoral boundaries in March.

Potential candidates began to be more visible on the ground shadowing incumbent MPs, as the party started to position its people for the electoral battle.

But everything was put on hold when infection numbers spiked in the foreign workers' dormitories and the country entered an eight-week circuit breaker shutdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Former PAP MP Inderjit Singh said the party had been ready for a contest as early as April or May this year.

Now, the PAP branches in each constituency are swiftly moving into high gear again for the short but intense electioneering.

""The manifestos are probably all ready, so are the posters and the nine-day campaign plan. Now, it is about executing the plan,"" he said.

With the Writ issued and Singapore in phase two of its economic reopening, activists say they are raring to go again.

""We've been walking the ground since the last GE ended (in September 2015), so residents already know and recognise us.

""But, of course, we cannot take things for granted and slow down. The ground campaign may not be as demanding but we will still have to go house to house,"" said an activist.

This time, limits on physical campaigning means candidates will be reaching out more actively to voters on cyberspace. For instance, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong and his Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC team are launching live chats with residents on Wednesday (June 24)

With an economic recession looming and rising job losses in the horizon, party activists and analysts say they are expecting a ""flight to safety"" from voters, who will likely turn to PAP, with its experience, to steer Singapore through the storm.

Said Mr Singh: ""The ground is not sweet, it is worried about the future and because people are worried, they will not vote recklessly.""

Other activists say their sense of ground sentiment is that people are generally satisfied with the fiscal support - four Budgets amounting to almost $93 billion - the Government has marshalled to fight Covid-19, support businesses and keep Singaporeans employed.

""There might be a lot of migrant workers infected but people can see that not many Singaporeans have been stricken by the bug. At the same time, they can see all the schemes that are available to help them,"" noted another activist.

In the face of the public health and economic crisis, the PAP activists interviewed foresee their party matching its result in the 2015 GE.

Related Story Singapore GE2020: What are the hot seats to watch this election

Held amid the 50th anniversary of Singapore's independence and six months after founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew died, the PAP won in 2015 with almost 70 per cent of the popular vote.

Previous crisis elections had yielded similarly high vote shares. For instance in the 2001 GE that was held soon after the Sept 11 terror attacks, the PAP got 75.3 per cent of the popular vote.

Institute of Policy Studies' deputy director for research Gillian Koh noted the party leaders in government had used the series of six ministerial broadcasts this month to emphasise to voters that they have the wherewithal to shepherd not just Singapore's short-term recovery, but also its longer term social and economic progress.

""The PAP, even with its new recruits, will try to emphasise it has a team that has the smarts, the experience and commitment to lead the country out (of the crisis) and generate sustained progress for the future,"" said Dr Koh.

This election, however, has another layer of importance for the ruling party: leadership transition.

The 4G leadership is set to take over in the next term of government, as fresh blood is being brought in to take the place of senior ministers retiring from politics.

Among those expected to step aside are political veterans, such as Mr Khaw Boon Wan from Sembawang GRC; Mr Lim Hng Kiang from West Coast GRC; Mr Lim Swee Say from East Coast GRC; and Prof Yaacob Ibrahim from Jalan Besar GRC.

But with Covid-19, the party has not had the same runway to officially introduce its new candidates - traditionally done at press conferences leading up to the issuance of the Writ of Election.

Still, activists say plans are afoot to do so in the few days ahead.

Among the prospectives are top public servants who have stepped down from their posts recently, signalling they could enter politics in the coming polls.

Some of them include:

- Former Infocomm Media Development Authority chief executive Tan Kiat How, 43, who is tipped to be fielded in East Coast GRC, where two incumbent MPs - Mr Lim Swee Say and Mr Li Yi Shyan - are expected to leave.

- Former air force brigadier-general Gan Siow Huang, 45, who is now deputy CEO of the National Trades Union Congress' (NTUC) Employment and Employability Institute, and is expected to be fielded in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

- Former brigadier-general Desmond Tan, 49, who left his post as People's Association chief executive earlier this month, and could be part of the PAP's team in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.

New faces from the private sector have also featured prominently in virtual discussions with residents and grassroots leaders in the past few months.

They include Changi Airport Group vice-president Poh Li San, 45, in Sembawang GRC; 39-year-old lawyer Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim in Chua Chu Kang GRC; and polytechnic senior lecturer Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah, 41.

Dr Wan Rizal appeared last Saturday (June 20) on a webinar with Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and Ms Denise Phua, both of whom are expected to be on the PAP's Jalan Besar GRC slate.

Activists say what remains is to make sure candidates' forms are in order, and orders are placed for last-minute campaign materials, including calling cards with candidates' pictures, and e-rally timings as well as Covid-19 essentials, like bottles of hand sanitizer with the party's logo on it.
