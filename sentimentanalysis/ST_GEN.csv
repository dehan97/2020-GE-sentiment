West Coast GRC

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Communications and Information Minister S. Iswaran and Ms Foo Mee Har were at Teban Gardens Market and Food Centre, interacting with members of the public.

During the walkabout, Mr Heng said the party's new face Ivan Lim should clarify the online criticisms he has received since being introduced on Wednesday.

""I have emphasised that integrity and character are very important in our candidates. And if there's any complaints, it should be properly clarified,"" he said. ""So I would like to see Ivan himself coming out to clarify this comment, so that we can hear both sides of the story.""

Members of the Progress Singapore Party, led by party chief Tan Cheng Bock, were at Block 726 West Coast Market Square, greeting residents. Dr Tan is expected to contest West Coast GRC.

Aljunied GRC

Mr Leon Perera, part of the Workers' Party line-up set to contest Aljunied GRC, greeted a resident at Block 538 Bedok North Street 3. The party held one of its first big market visits on Saturday, with nearly all party leaders present. WP chief Pritam Singh, chairman Sylvia Lim, Mr Gerald Giam and Mr Faisal Manap - all candidates for Aljunied GRC - were also at the walkabout.

Mr Shamsul Kamar, a grassroots adviser in the GRC where he is expected to contest for the PAP, was distributing food rations to the elderly and shopping vouchers to needy residents at Kaki Bukit Community Centre.

In a Facebook post later on Saturday, he said regardless of who will be standing for the elections, â€œour commitment to help residents cope through this difficult period is paramountâ€.

â€œThe work that will be cut out for us now is to secure Our Lives, Our Jobs And Our Future,â€ he wrote, citing the PAPâ€™s campaign slogan for this election. But he said: â€œI was not on the ground to campaign for the elections this morning. Perhaps it was somebody else.â€

Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC

The four-man Singapore People's Party (SPP) team for Bishan Toa-Payoh GRC led by party chief Steve Chia, 49, was accompanied by former party chairman Mrs Lina Chiam, 71, during a visit to the market at Block 127 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh and nearby coffee shops on Saturday morning.

Mrs Chiam, who twice contested Potong Pasir SMC after her husband Mr Chiam See Tong, 85, left in 2011 to contest Bishan-Toa Payoh, told reporters that it was time for the couple to retire and spend their ""golden years"" together after more than four decades in political life.

""Mr Chiam is OK. He has got mobility issues but his heart is still with our party... He knows what is happening and he will be watching the news,"" she said.

On her decision to step away from electoral politics, she added: ""I don't have regrets. In politics, there are ups and downs.

""Our biggest happiness is that the party still goes on and there are people still following us.""

Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC

Singapore Democratic Alliance chairman Desmond Lim was out on a walkabout at Edgefield Walk in Punggol with party members and SDA candidates for the constituency. While the party faces a three-cornered fight there with the Peoples Voice party, SDA chief media officer Harminder Pal Singh told reporters that both sides are in discussions.

""We have been urging many different parties... to not have a three-cornered fight,"" he said, speaking to reporters on Saturday at the party walkabout in Punggol. ""Opposition unity is very important.""

Marine Parade GRC

Incumbent Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin had breakfast with PAP new face Mohd Fahmi Aliman at Haig Road Food Centre on Saturday morning. Mr Fahmi is tipped to replace Associate Professor Fatimah Lateef.

Dr Tan See Leng also had breakfast this morning in the constituency, at Marine Terrace. Dr Tan is expected to replace Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, who on Thursday said he would be retiring as an MP after 44 years.

Later that day, Dr Tan distributed mosquito repellent and leaflets to residents of Blk 71 Marine Drive, to educate them about dengue prevention.

MacPherson SMC

People's Power Party chief Goh Meng Seng said during a walkabout in MacPherson that this would be his last contest in a general election.

""When I first got involved in politics, I told my wife to give me 15 years. But now, I've already crossed over 20 years. My daughter who wasn't even born then has now grown up. I don't want to put my family through too much,"" he said.

""Every election, we will lose money, I even sold my flat to finance the second one,"" he added, referring to the 2011 General Election where he contested Tampines GRC.

Mr Goh made his political debut when he contested Aljunied GRC with the Workers' Party in the 2006 General Election.

He was accompanied on his walkabout by members from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) including secretary-general Mohamad Hamim Aliyas, who confirmed that the DPP will not be contesting any constituency this election but will be supporting PPP and Mr Goh in his campaign for the MacPherson single seat.

Marsiling Yew-Tee GRC

After his morning at West Coast, Mr Heng also visited Causeway Point in Woodlands, with Minister of State for National Development and Manpower Zaqy Mohamad and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

The mall is in Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, where Mr Wong is the incumbent anchor minister who will likely lead the PAPâ€™s four-person team into the polls.

Mr Zaqy is expected to stand in the GRC, where he has been a grassroots adviser after Madam Halimah Yacob left in 2017 and was elected as the President. He is currently an incumbent for Chua Chu Kang GRC.

Hougang SMC

Mr Dennis Tan, WP candidate for Hougang SMC, was at a monthly food distribution drive in Hougang Ave 3 at about 2pm.

The initiative helps the lower income and needy families in the Hougang area, and the food is sponsored by a volunteer welfare organisation. Residents who were there for the distribution effort said Mr Tan and Hougang MP Png Eng Huat, who is stepping down, are a familiar sight at the drive.

Tanjong Pagar GRC

Mr Lee Hsien Yang, brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, was in Tanjong Pagar GRC. The younger Mr Lee was introduced as a PSP member this week, and was with Mr Terence Soon, the partyâ€™s candidate for the constituency.

They interacted with diners at Holland Village Food Centre and also went to HDB blocks in Holland Close on home visits, where they handed out fliers.

On Saturday (June 27), the Elections Department (ELD) said in a statement that it had received 226 applications for the Political Donation Certificate by the Friday deadline.

This means there could be as many candidates for 93 seats in Parliament, although a number of parties typically apply for additional or standby certificates.

Singapore's election rules require all candidates to submit political donation forms, on which they have to record donations received and declare that the funds are permitted under the law, among other things.

This paperwork is needed to obtain political donation certificates, which the Registrar of Political Donations will issue by the eve of Nomination Day.

Candidates seeking election will have to submit these certificates with their nomination papers on Nomination Day next Tuesday. They must also have a proposer, seconder and at least four assenters, who must all be eligible to vote in the constituency.

There were 220 applications for such certificates in the last general election in 2015.

ELD also said that it has received 37 applications for the Certificate of the Malay Community Committee and 35 for the Certificate of the Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee. Applications closed on Friday.

Every group of candidates who wishes to stand for parliamentary election in a group representation constituency (GRC) is required to have at least one candidate belonging to either the Malay community, or the Indian and other minority communities, depending on the requirement for that particular GRC."

Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing yesterday paid tribute to former WP chief Low Thia Khiang, whose party on Thursday said he is stepping down from electoral politics.

Mr Low's successor Pritam Singh also thanked Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong yesterday. Mr Goh had said he would be retiring as an MP on Thursday after 44 years.

Mr Singh, in a Facebook post, wrote about a Parliament session in May 2018, when he went to take his newly allocated seat opposite the Government's front bench - the same seat Mr Low sat in when he was party chief.

When Mr Goh walked in, Mr Singh said he got up from his seat to shake the former prime minister's hand. He said Mr Goh's first words to him were: ""Congratulations on your demotion! Previously you were sitting higher up, now you have come down!""

In his post, Mr Singh said: ""I appreciated his good humour and it went some way that day to put things into perspective for me.""

Mr Singh added that in the Parliament member's lounge, on more than one occasion, Mr Goh shared his thoughts with him on, among other things, issues such as the Government's position on the country's reserves, and how race was employed ""cynically"" in past elections by some.

Said Mr Singh: ""I have my own views about many of these matters shared by ESM Goh. But I thought it said something of the man - the second prime minister of Singapore - to engage not just me, but my Workers' Party colleagues outside the Parliament chamber.""

More recently, Mr Goh would always ask about how Mr Low was doing after his fall whenever he saw Mr Singh in Parliament.

Mr Singh said: ""From all of us at the Workers' Party, thank you for your service to Singapore, ESM Goh.""

Mr Goh, in his own Facebook post yesterday afternoon, said that he had retired as an MP but not from politics. He said: ""My key focus ahead is to support and strengthen the 4G leadership team, and ensure a smooth transition.

""Keeping Singapore going is like pushing a boulder up a hill. You have to keep on pushing or the boulder will roll back down. The 4G leaders are taking over the pushing of the boulder. Singaporeans must avoid the fate of Sisyphus,"" said Mr Goh, referencing the figure from Greek mythology who was forced to roll a boulder up a hill only for it to roll down whenever it neared the top.

Mr Chan, during a press conference to unveil new PAP candidates yesterday, was asked how Mr Low's decision to step down would affect the tone of the general election and the PAP's deployments.

He said: ""We thank Mr Low for his many years of service to the Workers' Party, and also to Singapore. And we hope that all of us will work together as a system to take Singapore forward.""

Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin also thanked Mr Low for his service, as well as friendship, in a Facebook post yesterday. ""We may be from different political sides and hold opposing views about issues, but I do know that we actually share many things in common. For one, I know that your heart is with Singapore and Singaporeans,"" said Mr Tan.

He added that he deeply appreciated the various conversations and discussions the pair have had on different issues.

He said: ""I hope we stay in touch. Most importantly, I wish you good health and happiness."""
37,GEN,https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/public-reminded-to-observe-safe-distancing-when-meeting-candidates,2020-06-27 05:00:00+08:00,Singapore GE2020: Public reminded to observe safe distancing when meeting candidates,"As election season hots up, there is a greater need for people to observe safe distancing rules, especially when they encounter candidates on the campaign trail.

The Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources, in a statement yesterday, listed these measures for the public to follow when supporting candidates as well as when they meet them on their walkabouts and door-to-door visits.

If they should encounter candidates on a walkabout, people are advised to keep a 1m distance from others, for example, when interacting with the candidates, or queueing for campaigning items.

They should also avoid physical contact with candidates and their supporters. This includes shaking hands and greetings with physical contact, such as fist bumps or high fives.

Members of the public should also wear face masks when interacting with candidates and avoid following or crowding around the candidates and their supporters.

Photographs can be taken but this should be done while maintaining at least a 1m distance and with a mask on.

When interacting with candidates on their door-to-door visits, residents should also stay 1m away from the candidates on their doorsteps and wear a mask.

Similar to the advice when encountering candidates on walkabouts, physical contact should be avoided.

Residents can invite candidates into their homes, but a limit of five visitors applies. This includes any other guests who may already be in their homes. Candidates, their supporters and residents should also continue to wear masks when inside the home.

The public are also warned against gathering around the Nomination Centre during nomination proceedings to avoid crowds forming.

They are encouraged to watch party political broadcasts, constituency political broadcasts and online rallies at home.

Safe distancing ambassadors and safe distancing enforcement officers will be on the ground, and the public are asked to cooperate with them.

""For the health and safety of everyone, it is paramount that political parties, candidates and members of the public abide by the above safe distancing and safe management measures. Everyone can do their part in ensuring a safe GE for all,"" the ministry said."
87,GEN,https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/3-way-fights-inevitable-with-record-12-opposition-parties-observers,2020-06-25 05:00:00+08:00,"Singapore GE2020: 3-way fights inevitable with record 12 opposition parties, say observers","Singapore could see more three-cornered fights in the 2020 General Election, with a record 12 opposition parties looking to enter the fray. As of yesterday, overlapping claims have yet to be resolved in at least four constituencies.

Both the Singapore People's Party (SPP) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have expressed interest in contesting the four-member Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, which a joint SPP-DPP team fought and lost in 2015 against the incumbent People's Action Party (PAP).

The five-member Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC could see the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA), which contested it in 2015, and the new Peoples Voice (PV) vying for votes.

At least two SMCs could also see three-cornered fights, with the Progress Singapore Party (PSP) coming up against the DPP in Marymount SMC and the Reform Party (RP) in the new Yio Chu Kang SMC respectively.

The PSP and RP had earlier clashed over West Coast GRC, which includes the Ayer Rajah ward where PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock was the PAP MP for six terms. Early yesterday morning, the RP, which contested West Coast in 2011 and 2015, said it would step aside after negotiations with the PSP.

The ruling PAP is contesting all 93 seats. Its pitch to voters is that it needs a strong mandate to be able to tackle the big challenges Singapore faces amid the pandemic-induced crisis.

Contests involving multiple parties have tended to benefit the ruling party, as the opposition vote ends up being split, observers note.

Dr Mustafa Izzuddin, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore, said multi-cornered fights are inevitable, especially in single-member constituencies, given the unprecedented number of parties contesting the election. But they are unlikely to happen in group representation constituencies, which require more resources to contest, he added.

""Even though there are a couple of GRCs with potential multi-cornered fights, my sense is once Nomination Day comes, the GRCs will likely be one-to-one fights.""

He felt the larger opposition parties were unlikely to pit themselves against one another.

Associate Professor Bilveer Singh from the National University of Singapore's (NUS) political science department agreed that three-or even four-cornered fights are inevitable. He said: ""The entrance of PSP onto the scene, as well as other new parties like PV and Red Dot United (RDU), has made the ground crowded and they all need to find a 'chair' somewhere to sit.""

STRAIGHT FIGHTS Even though there are a couple of GRCs with potential multi-cornered fights, my sense is once Nomination Day comes, the GRCs will likely be one-to-one fights. DR MUSTAFA IZZUDDIN, a senior international affairs analyst at management consultancy Solaris Strategies Singapore.

OPPOSITION POW-WOW There is not that much time if campaign collateral has to be produced, so I expect this to take place in the next day or two, if at all. It will be quite significant if no such meeting takes place. We will most definitely be in new territory with regard to opposition politics in Singapore if that is so. DR GILLIAN KOH, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, on opposition parties possibly holding off on having a conference for as long as possible while they wait for the PAP to announce where it is placing its candidates.

He noted that the much-hyped notion of an opposition coalition akin to Malaysia's Pakatan Harapan never materialised. Conflicts over ideologies and issues doomed this effort from the start, he added.

Political analyst Loke Hoe Yeong noted that even without an official alliance, the fact that the customary pre-election horse-trading talks between the opposition parties did not happen this year is a sign that opposition unity is fraying. But he said this is mostly due to the growing divergence between larger opposition parties and smaller parties, which are ""getting even smaller"". ""There is, frankly, no reason for the larger parties to have to negotiate with the smaller parties,"" said Mr Loke, who recently authored a book on the history of the opposition in Singapore titled The First Wave.

He said the opposition's earlier experiment with coalition-building, in the form of the SDA led by Mr Chiam See Tong, had ""failed miserably"" in the early 2000s. ""The idea was consigned to the grave in 2011, when the Workers' Party (WP) won its first GRC. That vindicated the WP's strategy of going it alone.""

Dr Gillian Koh, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies, said opposition parties could be holding off on having a conference for as long as possible while they wait for the PAP to announce where it is placing its candidates.

""There is not that much time if campaign collateral has to be produced, so I expect this to take place in the next day or two, if at all,"" she said. ""It will be quite significant if no such meeting takes place. We will most definitely be in new territory with regard to opposition politics in Singapore if that is so.""

Dr Mustafa pointed to the coronavirus pandemic as one reason the usual opposition pow-wow could not be conducted in person this year. But he said the larger and more established opposition parties have likely been negotiating behind the scenes to avoid three-cornered fights - at least among themselves.

Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian from NUS' political science department agreed, adding that three-cornered fights seem more likely to happen between smaller parties.

""The WP and, to a lesser degree, the SDP are more established. If they do not appear in three-cornered fights, then there may be recognition from the other parties that they would lose badly in multi-cornered contests,"" he said.

Associate Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University's School of Law said political parties exist to contest elections. They risk becoming irrelevant and may never recover if they fail to contest an election, he said.

But he believed overlapping claims will likely be resolved come Nomination Day. Although there has not been a ""multilateral"" pow-wow, parties have been negotiating in a ""bilateral"" fashion, said Prof Tan, a former Nominated MP.

""They will resolve the conflicts because they recognise that the Singaporean voter is savvy and the party that finishes third or lower will likely lose its deposit. It's not a small sum and that's not a price that some candidates and parties are prepared to pay, in addition to the reputational damage done.""

The election deposit has been set at $13,500 per candidate, which is forfeited if the candidate or team fails to win at least 12.5 per cent of the votes.

In 2015, there were three SMCs that saw three-cornered fights. Of those, two involved independent candidates while the third, MacPherson, saw a contest between the PAP, the WP and the National Solidarity Party (NSP). Both independent candidates and the NSP's Cheo Chai Chen, who garnered just 215 votes (0.82 per cent) in MacPherson, lost their $14,500 deposits.

Related Story Singapore GE2020: What are the hot seats to watch this election

Prof Tan said there was also the possibility that the lack of coordination could result in some seats going uncontested, allowing the PAP to have walkovers instead of multi-cornered fights.

Another reason three-cornered fights are increasingly likely is that older opposition cooperation tactics, such as banking on the so-called ""by-election effect"", are no longer relevant, the observers said.

The strategy, employed by Mr Chiam in 1991, involves opposition parties agreeing to contest fewer than half of the available seats in total. Like in a by-election, the logic goes, returning the PAP to power on Nomination Day means voters would be less skittish about supporting the opposition as there is no risk of inadvertently voting the PAP out.

Prof Singh, Dr Koh and Mr Loke agreed that the strategy has been irrelevant since 1997 when the PAP started using a more local, municipal approach and tying estate upgrading to voter support.

Prof Tan suggested that the opposition could move towards a nuanced strategy based on a similar line of thinking.

Most parties are aware that, given the challenges posed to Singapore by the Covid-19 pandemic, voters are more likely to support the tried-and-tested PAP, he said. As a result, the SDP's call to deny the PAP its two-thirds majority may not sit well with voters, for example.

Instead, if the WP adopts a moderate approach by contesting fewer than 31 seats, that sends a signal to voters that the PAP will not lose its two-thirds majority, even if the WP wins every seat it contests, said Prof Tan.

""I think that would go down much better with voters,"" he said.

With so many parties vying for seats across the board, however, voters would have to weigh up the chances that some seats, or even GRCs, might also be won by other opposition parties, thereby resulting in a weakened ruling party, with some key ministers or potential office holders being lost in the process. The PAP will, no doubt, seek to convince voters that such an outcome would hamper the country's ability to deal with the big issues it has to grapple with in the face of the health and economic crises unleashed by Covid-19."

The usual party political broadcasts, in which various parties will get a chance to address voters, will also be aired from 7pm. There will be two such broadcasts: On July 2 and 9, which is Cooling-off Day.

With large physical rallies disallowed in GE2020, in line with health advisories to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the constituency and party political broadcasts scheduled for prime time on national TV have taken on an added significance for candidates to reach out to voters.

The constituency political broadcasts, in particular, will give all candidates a chance to address voters on TV on Mediacorp's Channel 5.

Each candidate will get three minutes to speak, so a single-member constituency's broadcast will last three minutes, while that for a group representation constituency will be 12 or 15 minutes, depending on whether it is a four-or five-member GRC.

Recording will start from July 2, and candidates can opt to speak in any of the four official languages - English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil, the Elections Department (ELD) said yesterday.

This means Chinese dialects, which are sometimes spoken at rallies, will not be allowed.

The constituency broadcasts may be the only way some parties may get TV airtime, as the party political broadcast time slots will be offered only to parties fielding at least six candidates under a recognised party symbol.

This rule, which was already in place in previous general elections, will remain this time round.

The ELD said eligible parties will be informed of their allocated time for the party political broadcasts on Nomination Day.

As with the constituency broadcasts, these party-level broadcasts can be delivered only in the four official languages.

BALANCE NEEDED There is a need to strike a balance between providing political parties and candidates with media platforms to reach out to voters, and keeping mainstream media non-partisan and neutral. THE ELECTIONS DEPARTMENT, on the amount of time allocated to political broadcasts for the general election.

All these broadcasts will be aired across 19 TV and radio channels.

The ELD said all broadcasts should not contain content that is of a libellous or criminal nature.

It added that the Infocomm Media Development Authority will issue more guidelines on the broadcasts by today.

As restrictions due to Covid-19 have caused much of the campaigning to go online, the Government will also provide venues for parties to live-stream their rallies.

Power, Internet connectivity and basic furnishings will be provided at these venues, but candidates must make their own arrangements to ensure successful delivery of their live streams.

Up to 10 venues will be provided each day, with three time slots - from 7am to 10am, noon to 3pm, and 7pm to 10pm - for each venue, and candidates can apply to use them from July 1 to 8. The booking fee for each time slot is $107.

The ELD said use of the venues is optional, and candidates are free to live-stream their rallies from other places.

It added that online platforms used for live-streaming will have to be declared to the Returning Officer. Foreigners are also barred from participating in these live streams.

""The increased airtime - in the form of greater audience reach through more platforms and at different timings - will help candidates to reach voters with varying media consumption habits at a national level,"" said ELD.

The department also stressed the importance of cyber security, and reminded political parties and candidates to protect their social media accounts, among other things.

""If candidates and political parties suspect their accounts or systems have been compromised or misused, they should lodge a police report immediately and keep ELD informed,"" it said.

This means that when voters or supporters become too effusive and the parties are unable to control the crowd, they may want to consider disengaging and leaving the area in the interest of public health, the ELD said yesterday.

A day after the Writ of Election was issued, outreach activities were ramped up and yesterday, the ELD gave more details on how potential candidates should conduct themselves during nomination proceedings and campaigning.

There were rules set out in the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020, and also best practices.

At an online media briefing attended by ELD representatives as well as National Environment Agency chief executive officer Tan Meng Dui, who will be the election's Returning Officer, the ELD said that said the same Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines that apply to the public will also apply to the political candidates.

An issue that has caused confusion is the wearing of masks, with some candidates keeping them on at all times and others removing them when posing for photos.

Yesterday, the ELD said candidates have to follow the MOH's rules on mask wearing, and they should keep their masks on when they are taking photos or talking to others.

An exception to the mask rule is when candidates are eating or drinking at hawker centres. Even then, they should minimise talking as a best practice, to reduce the risk of droplets spreading, the ELD added.

Another instance where they may remove their masks is when they are recording, say a doorstop interview, for only a few minutes, and this is done in places where they can keep a safe distance of at least 1m away from others.

In these situations, all other individuals around the candidate who is speaking should keep their masks on, said the ELD.

But it is best if candidates keep their masks on in these situations, the ELD added. ""This is especially so when in settings where it may be difficult to maintain safe distancing or comply with other safe management measures.""

It also advised candidates to bring masks, adding that misplacing or forgetting to bring masks out is not a reasonable excuse for not wearing one in public.

Since the general election was called on Tuesday, many parties have hit the campaign trail on walkabouts while keeping their groups to no more than five people. Most have also kept to the rules of maintaining a 1m distance from others.

The ELD acknowledged this, saying it shows that campaigning can be done while respecting the safety measures that have been put in place to guard against the spread of the coronavirus.

It called on the political parties to set a good example, and nudge their supporters in the right direction.

Some of its suggestions were for candidates and volunteers to keep interactions with the public transient and to avoid handshakes, high fives and fist bumps to minimise physical contact.

In addition, they should leave a location when the crowd becomes unmanageable, and ensure that people do not crowd around to collect fliers or election paraphernalia.

Safe distancing measures should be put in place, if people are standing in a queue or at a table to collect the items, it added.

Members of the public can play their part too, said the ELD, suggesting that people watch political broadcasts at home, and avoid gathering or loitering near nomination centres during nomination proceedings.

When candidates and volunteers visit, people should also allow into their home only up to five visitors, all of whom should be masked up.

Encouraging candidates to take their temperature daily and to stay home if they are unwell, the ELD said: ""All political parties and candidates are strongly encouraged to exercise positive leadership and set a good example to the public, by following these best practices.

""Political parties and candidates must also follow advice from safe distancing ambassadors and safe distancing enforcement officers."""

But the proceedings this year will be much more subdued, with entry into the centres restricted owing to Covid-19.

Nomination Day is on June 30 in this general election.

As in previous elections, candidates are required to submit their documents at these centres and be accompanied by their subscribers, who include a proposer, a seconder and between four to eight assentors.

From 10am, candidates can enter the schools which are being used as nomination centres.

They will first be directed into a holding area and, from 10.30am, they can enter the nomination place, typically the school hall, if they meet the requirement of having the relevant documents, like a political donation certificate. They must also be accompanied by their subscribers.

Between 11am and 12pm, candidates will have to file their nomination papers. They have up to 12.30pm to object to the nomination papers of other candidates contesting in the same constituency.

Supporters, who are typically allowed in the centres as well, will not be able to enter them in this election.

After 12.30pm, candidates will be allowed to make their thank-you speeches, which will be aired on TV and online. For candidates who are unwell, their authorised representative can make the speech on their behalf.

To reduce physical contact during nomination proceedings, the Elections Department has beefed up its digital services for candidates.

Before Nomination Day, candidates can pay their election deposit of $13,500 via e-payment, like PayNow, and get an electronic receipt, instead of making a trip to the Accountant-General's Department. They can also appoint election agents and apply for a political donation certificate online, as well as apply online for a minority community certificate for those running in group representation constituencies.

The ELD said yesterday it would process most of these forms by the next working day, except for applications for the minority community certificates which will be issued before Nomination Day, after applications for the certificates close two clear days before Nomination Day.

Candidates can also submit their photographs and names for printing on ballot papers through the online channel.

Those who want to do a draft of their nomination papers online can also do so, which will allow them to check the details of their proposers, seconders and assentors to ensure they are all listed in the updated Register of Electors.

To use these online services, they will have to log in using their SingPass accounts, for accountability and security, said the ELD.

It added that candidates who prefer to submit forms in hard copy can continue to do so, but they should download and print the forms from the ELD website instead of getting them in person at the ELD's premises.

These and other changes to election processes for GE2020 are published in the Candidate Handbook, Guide for Polling Agents and Guide for Counting Agents. They are available on the ELD website."

The number of seats in the next Parliament will grow from 89 to 93.

The minimum number of opposition MPs, including Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs), will go up from nine to 12, as a result of changes made to the NCMP scheme in 2016.

NCMPs will be given the same voting rights as elected MPs.

2 NEW CONSTITUENCIES

There are four new single seats: Punggol West, which has been carved out of Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC; Kebun Baru, formerly part of Nee Soon GRC; Marymount, previously from Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC; Yio Chu Kang, which had been part of Ang Mo Kio GRC.

3 KEY BOUNDARY CHANGES

Residents in the Joo Seng area of Marine Parade GRC will move to Potong Pasir SMC, while residents of Lorong 8 Toa Payoh will now vote in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.

Fengshan residents are now part of East Coast GRC.

More than half of Sengkang West's residents will join the new four-member Sengkang GRC, with the rest going to Ang Mo Kio GRC.

Punggol East residents will also vote in Sengkang GRC.

4 NO PHYSICAL RALLIES

No police permits will be granted for rallies and no gatherings of supporters will be allowed. Campaigning can be carried out online.

Walkabouts are limited to no more than five people in each group.

No mixing is allowed between groups.

5 CONSTITUENCY POLITICAL BROADCASTS

For the first time, constituency political broadcasts will air on Mediacorp's Channel 5.

Each single-member constituency candidate gets three minutes for these broadcasts.

Each group of GRC candidates gets 12 or 15 minutes, depending on the group representation constituency size.

This is in addition to the two party political broadcasts on 19 TV/radio channels, up from 13 TV/radio channels in 2015.

6 PRECAUTIONS AGAINST FOREIGN INTERFERENCE

Political parties have been told to watch out for foreign interference and cyber-security risks during the election.

7 VOTERS ON STAY-HOME NOTICE

Special polling stations will be set up for people on stay-home notice (SHN) at designated facilities such as hotels.

For other affected voters, such as those serving SHN at home, the Elections Department will consult the Health Ministry to assess the public health risks of allowing them to vote.

8 PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES AT POLLING STATIONS

Voters will be given recommended two-hour time slots to visit polling stations.

Morning slots will be reserved for seniors.

Temperature screening at the stations will sieve out those with fever or respiratory symptoms. Whether these groups will be allowed to vote will depend on the prevailing Covid-19 situation during the polls.

9 SAFER AND SMOOTHER PROCESS FOR CASTING VOTES

New self-inking pens, which will allow voters to easily stamp an ""X"" for the party of their choice, will be used. Cleaners will be deployed at all polling stations to clean items and areas described as ""common touch points"" such as the self-inking pens and polling booths. They will do so at least once every half an hour."

The widely anticipated announcement of the election date came yesterday, when President Halimah Yacob dissolved Singapore's 13th Parliament and issued the Writ of Election.

Nomination Day will be next Tuesday, with the minimum nine days of campaigning before Cooling-Off Day on July 9.

Polling Day will be on July 10 - a Friday and a public holiday.

In a televised address to the nation yesterday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he has decided to call the general election now, while the Covid-19 situation is relatively stable, to ""clear the decks"" and give the new government a fresh, full five-year mandate.

After the election, the new government can focus on the national agenda - which includes handling the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and jobs - and the difficult decisions it will have to make and to carry, he said.

The alternative is to wait out the pandemic, he said, noting however that there is no assurance the outbreak will be over before the Government's term ends next April, with the virus expected to linger for at least a year - most probably longer - until a vaccine is available.

The election, Singapore's 13th since independence, is likely to see the People's Action Party (PAP) challenged for all seats - as the ruling party was in 2015.

A total of 93 elected seats are at stake - in 17 group representation constituencies and 14 single-member constituencies.

GE2020 will be waged on a drastically different battleground due to the pandemic.

Safe distancing rules that restrict the size of public gatherings to five people mean traditional campaign staples like mass rallies cannot be held. Political parties will also have to scale back on the scope of their walkabouts in constituencies.

They have geared up to turn to cyberspace and social media instead, to get their messages across to the electorate. Each candidate will also get airtime on national television, as part of the new, one-off constituency political broadcasts.

Following the announcement yesterday, political parties sprang into action and ramped up their planning and preparations.

Due to safe distancing restrictions, they ironed out campaign strategies via WhatsApp messages and Zoom calls, instead of traditional meetings in larger groups.

The PAP will launch official introductions of its new candidates and release its party manifesto over the course of this week.

Opposition parties said they were ready for the election, as the possibility of one has been on the cards for some time.

Observers reckon issues that will feature prominently at the hustings include the state of the economy and jobs, the Government's handling of the coronavirus situation, political succession and the setting of the direction of Singapore's future after Covid-19.

The PAP's leaders have, in a series of six national broadcasts over the past two weeks, set out the key issues at stake, including protecting jobs, overcoming the current crisis and securing Singapore's future.

Meanwhile, opposition parties are expected to question the Government's handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, and call for greater accountability as well as more checks and balances to keep the ruling party on its toes.

The pandemic has brought economies to a near standstill, as countries lock down to curb the spread of the virus. Singapore's economy is projected to shrink by up to 7 per cent this year, which would make it the worst recession since independence in 1965.

In response, the Government has rolled out nearly $93 billion to fund four Covid-19 support packages, requiring a draw of up to $52 billion from past reserves.

This coming election will see Mr Lee lead the PAP into battle for the fourth, and what looks set to be the final, time as prime minister.

He had earlier declared his intention to hand over the reins to his successor by the time he turns 70, which will be in 2022.

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who leads the PAP's fourth-generation team, is poised to take over.

The 2006 General Election, the first led by Mr Lee, saw the PAP get 66.6 per cent of the popular vote.

The ruling party saw its vote share fall to 60.1 per cent in the 2011 election, but rebounded to secure 69.9 per cent of the vote in 2015.

There will be 2,653,942 voters heading to the polls next month.

There will also be a minimum of 12 opposition MPs in Parliament - including Non-Constituency MPs - up from nine currently. This stems from changes to the Constitution that were passed to guarantee that number, should there be fewer than 12 elected opposition MPs.

The Returning Officer for this election is Mr Tan Meng Dui, replacing Mr Ng Wai Choong, who was the Returning Officer for the 2015 General Election.
